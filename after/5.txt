hey  charlie  teddy here
on the couch where i almost got my first kiss with spencer
but she didn't
no no  because
i made the mistake of bringing the cute boy home
where my dear family lives
he wasn't that cute
get out
anyway  still waiting on that first kiss
but there's a dance this friday
where the girls ask the guys
and this time i'm going to make sure i get it
get what  honey
oh  my first a  in science  daddy
that's my girl
hey  dad  great news  i got a job
stop right there  i'm having the greatest dream of my life
the school's gonna pay me 100 bucks to dj at the dance on friday
the dream continues
i just need you to give me  200 to rent the dj equipment
and now i'm awake
hey  what was i doing in the dream
you weren't saying anything  which is why i thought it was a dream
p j   why would you take a job where you're gonna lose money
does everything always have to be about money
are you giving me the 200
sorry  son  you're gonna have to come up with the money some other way
like how
oh  i know  get a job
i'll be right back
wait  where's your sister
don't bother her  emmett
okay  where shouldn't i bother her
in the kitchen
all right  thanks
hey  teddy bear
hey  emmett
you know this dance this friday night is"girls ask guys " right
uh huh
you're a girl  i'm a guy
something you want to ask me
okay  emmett  listen
p j  is my brother and you're his best friend
so in a way you're kind of like my brother too
and i can't go to the dance with my brother
you can see why that would be wrong  right
this is the longest conversation we've ever had
did you hear anything i just said
something about wanting to go to the dance with a brother
emmett  i want you to listen to me very carefully
i'm not going to ask you to the dance
when you touch me it feels like electricity
today's all burnt toast
running late  and dad jokes
has anybody seen my left shoe
i close my eyes  take a bite
grab a ride  laugh out loud
there it is up on the roof
i've been there  i've survived
so just take my advice
hang in there  baby
things are crazy
but i know your future is bright
hang in there  baby
there is no maybe
eveything turns out all right
sure life is up and down
but trust me  it comes back all around
you're gonna love who you turn out to be
hang in there  baby
good luck charlie  s01e05  dance off
hi  kids
hey  mom
come on  charlie  let's go see daddy
you know what i realized today
charlie's never played laser tag
i bet she'd enjoy doing that on friday night
oh  how very sweet and unselfish of you
but charlie's gonna be with us friday night
it's your school's open house
right  forgot about that
well  we haven't
dad and i can't wait to meet this miracle worker  mrs  mellish
she's the first teacher who hasn't called to complain about you
are you sure he's actually going to school
mom  you've been to so many open houses
and you'd love laser tag
it's like a workout but you get to shoot stuff
oh  come on  we can play laser tag anytime
meeting a teacher that has no problems with you  
that may never happen again
this is bad
what's bad
the only reason i haven't been getting in trouble
is that i told my teacher mom and dad have been fighting a lot
that actually works
you also have to give the teacher one of these
wow  that's good
i almost hugged you  and i never want to hug you
works even better on mrs  mellish
any time i do something wrong  
mommy and daddy were fighting again
wow
well  i guess your evil plan is gonna be over on friday night
'cause mom and dad won't be fighting
or will they
so who are you asking to the dance
okay  here's a hint  he's really cute and  
you ladies talking about me again
you know i'm not talking about you
since i dumped your sorry butt a long time ago
that's now how me and my sorry butt remember it
remind me again why you ever went out with him
only one way to explain it  
brain fart
brain fart
so who's this cutie you're gonna ask
spencer
oh  right
mr  almost first kiss
you'd better get moving on that  your window is closing
what window
the window of opportunity
oh  thanks  that really clears things up
t  you almost kissed this guy
but nothing happened since then
if you don't act soon  you're doomed to be just friends
i like spencer  he likes me
and i'll ask him when the time is right
that better be right now  chica
because lauren sandoval is gonna ask him
lauren would never do that to me  she's too good a friend
there's your good friend right now
here  walking up to spencer
what  that little witch
yeah
oh  lauren  you poor thing
what a horrible  ugly tomatoey mess you are
come on  pizza face  let's get you cleaned up
come on
oh  spencer  hey  didn't see you there
hi  teddy
boy  that pizza really came out of nowhere  huh
yeah  nice shot
it's all in the wrist
now tell me again
and don't leave out a single detail  
what exactly did spencer say when you asked him
he said  and i quote
"okay "
oh  wouldn't it be so romantic
if i got my first kiss during a slow dance
that could happen if you don't wear that red polka dot thing
that makes you look like a clown
no no  you're right
i should dress more subtle and understated
like you
that's all i'm saying
now i just have to figure out
how spencer and i are gonna get to the dance
how are you getting there
i haven't asked anyone yet
i'm still trying to decide between five guys
well  do any of them drive
let's see
sophomore  freshman  sophomore
eighth grader i don't really want to talk about
and sophomore
so no  no drivers on the list
that's too bad  because if you could find somebody who drives
then spencer and i could double with you
yeah  consider it done  i'll just expand my list
and lower my standards a little bit
lower than the eighth grade
you want a ride or not
okay  they say it's gonna be chilly tonight
i want to make sure you're nice and toasty
did i remember to change your diaper
i'm gonna go with yes
are you ready to go
yeah
it is gonna be so nice to go to an open house
and not to have to hear the words
"oh  you're gabe's parents "
mom  are you wearing perfume
i am
oh
what  you don't like it
oh  i like it  but
but what  does someone else not like it
i don't want to get dad in trouble
wait  dad says he doesn't like my perfume
he doesn't just say it  he makes a face too
and sometimes there's gagging
oh
well  that's interesting
has your father shared anything else with you
about how i disgust him
i've said too much already
oh  okay
okay
nice jacket  dad
isn't it  got my company logo right there  
free advertising and a great conversation starter
does mom know you're wearing it
oh  i've been dressing myself for some time now
so no  i didn't run it by her
oh  i guess she'll just have to live with it
why  is there a problem
i don't want to get mom in trouble
but just between us
she thinks you talk too much about your job
i talk too much about my job  
the same job that puts a roof over your mother's head
hey  i'm on your side
so what else does she say about me behind my back
i've said too much already
come on  guys  gotta go  gonna be late
well  we're taking the bug truck
if that's okay with you
as long as the windows work
i don't want to trigger anyone's gag reflex
women
hey  good luck at your open house tonight
good luck at whatever you're dressed so weird for
look at you
oh  no  look at you
well  i wish i was someone else
so i could look at both of us
so where's your date
parking the car
oh  i like it  who is he
okay  about that   there's something you should know  
'sup
emmett  would you excuse us for a minute real quick
okay  just  
emmett
we needed transportation
it was either emmett or an eighth grader
with a skateboard
let's just go have a good time  okay
shall we
teddy bear
grizzly bear
you look really nice
you are really nice
thanks
whose car is this
my grandpa's  he thinks i'm at the store getting bread
but instead
you'll be at the dance getting nothing
wow  looks like my seat belt's broken
maybe i should sit in the middle
is that okay
yeah
'cause i'm all about safety
teddy  you're blocking my view
you mind moving away from spencer
big guy  lean the other way
more
more
emmett  if he leans any more  he'll fall out of the car
more
well  this is my classroom
mrs  mellish looks busy
maybe we should come back next year
whoa  p u alert
i get it  okay
i'm talking about charlie's diaper  what's her problem
heck if i know
and for your information
some people find that scent very pleasant
a full diaper
i'm gonna be back in a minute
i'm gonna go change charlie  okay
okay
hi  gabe
hi  mrs  mellish
how is my brave little soldier
not good  mom and dad are fighting again
oh  you poor thing
they've been fighting all week
i don't think i can get that book report into time you on tuesday
that's okay  dear
you take all the time you need
i don't need time
i need happiness
oh
all right  that song was brought to you by freddy's stereo hut
when you're ready to rock steady  go see freddy
p j   what's with all the commercials
that's how i'm paying for all the equipment
i got some sponsors to buy advertising
who would buy advertising from you
you'd be surprised
this next one is brought to you by mom
who gave me 20 bucks
mom   when you absolutely  positively
can't get any more money out of dad
bob  come here  honey  look
look at this picture gabe drew
isn't that sweet
yeah  it sure is  you know what  honey
i guess we're doing something right
would you look at that
gabe  it seems like your parents are getting along
i'm gonna go introduce myself
gotta think  gotta think
it's go time  ricky
excuse me  lady  you've got a rat on your shoulder
rat on the loose
remain calm  remain calm
remain calm  remain calm
spencer  could you get me some punch  please
sure  i'll be right back
emmett  why don't you go get me some punch too
what  your feet don't work
ice or no ice
surprise me
i think it's time for me to make my move
go get that kiss  girl
hey  p j   put on a slow song  okay
you got it  sis
okay  we're gonna bring it down now
just like you should bring yourselves down to wally's waffles
tell them p j  sent you  you can get a free pat of butter
here you go
oh  thanks
let's dance
yo  quick  throw on some hip hop
but i just started this song
now
okay  this next one is brought to you by emmett
emmett   he's
standing right there
what just happened
emmett stole my date
back we go  little guy
safe and sound
boy  really tired  we should go
thank you  mr  duncan  that was very impressive
well  when you've been in the pest control biz
as long as i have  you  
you know  i really shouldn't talk about my work
it bugs my wife
no  it doesn't  why would you think that
because gabe told me it did
charlie looks more tired than me  so
gabe told me you hated my perfume
i never said that  what are you talking about
oh  please don't do this here
isn't it bad enough that poor gabe has to listen
to you two constantly fighting at home
we don't fight at home  we're very happy
look at this picture gabe drew of our family
that's not his
that's gabe m's
this is gabe d's
that's disturbing
mrs  mellish  i assure you we're a very loving family
gabe  get your butt over here
now why would you tell your teacher that we're fighting at home
so i could get out of doing my work
i'm in big trouble  right
oh  yeah
have all your overdue assignments on my desk monday morning
but that'll take me the whole weekend
you poor thing
get your coat  we're leaving
i can't believe we let him play us like that
i know  how could i ever think you didn't like my perfume
well  it's not my favorite
said the guy with the cartoon cockroach on his blazer
it's an ant
man  your jerking is dope
man  your popping   sick
i'd like to pop both of these jerks
sorry you didn't get that kiss
yeah  well  the night's not over yet
follow my lead
hey  what's that noise
what noise
the noise teddy is talking about
sounds like it's coming from the back of the car
yeah  i hear it too  it sounds bad
you should probably pull over and check it out
  i'm telling you      stop the car
just come on  i'll show you where the noise is coming from
i know where the noise is coming from
you want to keep that head
i suggest you not do that again
oh  sorry  sorry
in my head that went a lot smoother
hello there
hi
look  i'm sorry i got so caught up with emmett and the dancing
i kind of like the way things were going before then
yeah  me too
i'm glad we got to go to the dance together
i was a little nervous because
ivy said my window closing
and then lauren sandoval almost asked you
and then ivy and emmett showed up at my house
and i was like  "oh  no  how is it gonna working "
and i just  
that was a really nice way of telling me to shut up
well  charlie  i finally got my first kiss tonight
and now i can't stop smiling
i mean who knew that emmett's grandpa's car
would turn out to be the most romantic place in the world
okay  i'm gonna try and stop smiling
no  i can't do it
man  look at that girl working
wow  i thought we were good
not as good as that
she's got it going on
