mrs  dabney with her stupid questions
i have a follow up question  
may i speak to your sister
what can i do for you  mrs  dabney
i'm going out of town for a couple of days
and i was wondering if y'd be kind enough
to look after my cat caboodle
oh  i don't know  i'm awfully busy
i'll pay you  20 a day
my schedule just opened up
mm hmm
i can trust you  right
of course
you do seem to be
the least disturbed of all the duncan kids
what an almost sweet thing to say
you need to know that caboodle
is the most important thing in the world to me
how's mr  dabney doing
like i said  love that caboodle
i who is it   i
kwikki chikki
oh  hello
hi  it's  21 07
oh  okay  who is this cutie pie
i'm p j
i meant the other cutie pie
oh  this is charlie  she's my baby sister
why  isn't she the most precious thing in the whole world
yeah  my mom's at the hospital
so i'm looking after her
oh  you poor dear
keep the change
are you sure  this is almost a  20 tip
oh  you need it more than i do
what with your mom being in the hospital and all
oh  you think my mom is in  
i'm not gonna lie to you  it's been hard
enjoy your chicken
charlie  welcome to the chicken delivery business
give him dry food twice a day
and make sure his water bowl is always filled
oh  and my sister virginia is coming by later for a play date
you want me to have a play date with your sister
not you   caboodle
virginia brings her cat stanley over
what a ridiculous name for a cat
caboodle
stanley
oh  i should go
but so my little caboodie won't make a scene
you need to distract him
should i pretend to be a mouse
yes
i was joking
i wasn't
the cat seems fine to me
i'm paying you
now put him down and act like a mouse
squeak squeak
you can do better than that
bare your teeth  wiggle your nose
and act like you're eating a piece of cheese
now keep doing that for 20 minutes
and he should be fine  goodbye  my caboodle
teddy honey  did you lose something
only my dignity
mom  can you help me with something
sure  honey  what can i do for you
well  i have this friend
and he needs to know how to talk to girls
does this friend have a name
no orman
no orman
that's an odd name
well  i think he's from no orway
gabe honey  i'm your mom
you don't have to be embarrassed
about telling me about your first crushy wushy
i'm just gonna go look it up on the internet
no no no  it's okay
i'm sorry  i'm sorry
okay  so what have you said to her so far
um  i said
"that was juice  not pee "
and then she walked away
oh  no orman
every time i get near her
my heart starts pounding  my hands get all sweaty
and i can't speak
oh  you've got it bad
i remember my first crush
was it dad
sure  why not
so what do i do  how do i talk to her
well  when you start to get a little nervous
just ask her questions  let her do the talking
find things you have in common
so just ask her stuff and listen to the answers
that sounds easy
sure
relationships are a piece of cake
that's why married people are always so happy
did dad ever get nervous talking to you
oh  when your dad and i first started dating
we didn't do a lot of talking  mostly we just  
just what
played checkers  
lots and lots of checkers
i hey  dad   i
hey
you're taking care of charlie tomorrow afternoon  right
i believe i am
you know  i was thinking maybe
she should come to work with me
why
because i feel i didn't do enough to help out
when teddy and gabe were babies
enough  you didn't do anything
i know
and it haunts me
it haunts you
yes
that's why i have to make it up to you with charlie
okay
i'll miss you  dad
oh  that boy's up to something
i should probably get into this
eh  he's all the way upstairs
i listen and find things in common   i
i listen and find things in common   i
  hi     hi
tell me about yourself
why
i mean  only if you want to
okay  what do you want to know
tell me about your family
oh  the family
actually there's not much to tell
i'm an only child
me too
cool
what else
well  my parents are divorced
mine too
who do you live with
who do you live with
my mom
me too
wow  we really have a lot in common
you know  i had a feeling we might
want half of a peanut butter sandwich
no  thanks  i'm allergic to peanuts
me too
you dnt do much  do you
hey hey  catch
or stay
good cat
mrs  dabney  why are you back here
oh  i'm not estelle  i'm her sister virginia
wow  you really look like mrs  dabney
except for my laugh lines
estelle doesn't have any of those
gabe  this is mrs  dabney's twin sister virginia
this is my brother gabe
oh  you look like a nice little boy
would you like some candy
only if you eat one first
you're as cute as the dickens
okay  this is dang freaky
okay  stanley
let's go play with caboodle
here we go
uh oh
what's wrong
caboodle always gets excited when stanley arrives
he's just been lying on the couch all day
do you think he's sick
you'd better hope not
i'd hate to be in your shoes
if something happened to my sister's baby
well  it's not my fault
she'd understand that  right
oh  yeah  she's very understanding
come on  caboodle  perk up
this does not look good
oh  i know what will cheer you up  
mr  mouse  right
this does not look good either
the whole family's pitching in to help out with charlie
because my mom's in the hospital
thank you
and thank  i you   i
used to be her halloween costume
but with mom in the hospital
we can't afford to buy her a winter coat  
a new winter coat
is your mom any better
the same
but we're trying to be brave
you poor thing
aww
it's hardest on the little ones
whenever we visit mom in the hospital
charlie does this
mama mama mama
warren  get out here
and bring your wallet
thanks for coming on such short notice  dr  tushy
it's pronounced "tushy "
you don't have to thank me
caboodle dabney is one of my favorite patients
i didn't know veterinarians made house calls
oh  they don't  i'm a therapist
a therapist for cats
and birds  but never at the same time
you only make that mistake once
uh huh  huh
oh
so what's wrong with caboodle
well  his aura is off  his chakras are out of line
how's his poop
fine  how's yours
well  that's a little personal
but since you ask  super good and getting better
maybe we should get back to the cat  dr  tushy
it's "tushy "
tushy
huh uh  tushy
tushy
tushy tushy tushy
do you have a first name
tish
tish tushy
"doctor "
anyway  can you fix him
no
but you can  caboodle is feeling abandoned
he needs to know he's safe and secure
now close your eyes and send him a thought
to let him know you care
can't you give him a shot or  
send him a thought
send him a thought  send him a thought
do you have a thought
oh  i'm having a few of them
kit
hi  gabe
what are you doing here
i told my mom all about you
and we just wanted to say hi
yeah  it is so wonderful that kit met someone
with a family just like ours
okay
do you mind if we come in
yeah  sure  i guess
okay
you know  i'll actually be right back
okay
i have a big problem  what are you doing
i'm readjusting caboodle's aura  duh
i'm in big trouble
what's wrong
the girl i like is here with her mom
what's wrong with that
i told her mom and dad are divorced
and i'm an only child  what am i gonna do
okay  the first thing you're gonna do is calm down
your negative energy is upsetting the cat
you gotta help me
okay  relax
or later you're gonna have trouble with your poop
teddy
fine  i'll go and get rid of them
wait  they can't know you're my sister
right  so i will be somebody else
hi  i'm teddy  the housekeeper   see
hi  i'm dana  this is kit
why are you wearing a cat
because in my country we have a saying
"the house looks its best when a cat's on your chest "
what country is that
canada
mrs  duncan isn't home and i have a house to clean
so as we say in my country  "oot "
"oot oot "
okay  could you just tell her we stopped by
you betcha
hey  everybody
who's that
that's the chicken delivery guy
dude  what's with the cat
none of your business
and don't call me "dude " chicken delivery guy
now come out to the porch
where i will teach you how to use a doorbell
you know what's weird
he didn't have any chicken
he's just here to take our order
then another guy comes and delivers it
it's not a good system
i'm the chicken delivery guy
see
that is such an adorable baby  is she  
part of the promotion  right  p j
which may or may not be your name
that's right  a promotion
kwikki chikki is introducing
baby back ribs
and they make you carry around a baby
that comes from corporate
they have no idea what it's like out in the field
look who's here  who is here
hi  i'm bob
the exterminator
yeah  i'm a little more than that
why are you wearing a cat
oh  forget the cat  there is a skunk in the backyard
and i demand you go exterminate it right now
what are you talking about
skunks don't come out during the day
well  then go out and tell him that
sorry about that
he does good work  but he's a little chatty
mom  no
well  hello to you too
hello
hi  i'm dana  i'm kit's mom
i'm amy
this baby is so cute
isn't she
she sure makes me want some baby back ribs
beg pardon
no skunk back there  oh  hey  sweetie
hey
wow  you're very friendly with the exterminator
i do sleep next to him every night
i didn't realize you had a boyfriend
she's got a what
the exterminator is your boyfriend
the exterminator is my husband
so you remarried
i was never divorced
well  kit told me you were
because that's what gabe told me
i may have told a teeny little lie
sorry  i just wanted you to like me
gabe  you should have just told me the truth
i know  and i promise
from now on i'll always be completely honest with you
i'm back
now who's this
that's either virginia who's nice and gives out candy
or mrs  dabney   her evil twin
we're out of here
well  charlie  the good news is caboodle's fine
turns out all he needed was a trip to the litter box
but the bad news is gabe's romance with kit is over
well  the good news is
i don't have to shower anymore
that's really good news
so if your brother gabe
goes to give you a hug
well  good luck  charlie
don't worry  that won't happen
hey  mom  charlie and i have to work a double tomorrow
what  why do you keep taking charlie to work
because i love her
nobody
may i help you
i just wanted to drop off this casserole
excuse me
well  with p j 's mom being in the hospital
and him practically having to raise charlie on his own  
it's just so sad
you think  
gosh  that smells good
it is sad
  i find when people are in need     thank you
kids  dinner's ready
it's open
there's another one
there's another one
what
