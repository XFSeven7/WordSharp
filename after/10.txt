i forgot to tell you something
it's about your uncle mel    he called
i don't wanna hear it
oh  come on  he begged me to pass on the message
thank you  and now i'm going to pass on the message
who's uncle mel
somebody you'll never know
he's your father's uncle
okay  so you told me about uncle stanley
who knits sweaters for his cats
but you didn't want to tell me about uncle mel
because  teddy  if you don't have
anything nice to say about someone
then don't say anything at all
and mel's an idiot
okay  mom  tell me about uncle mel
well  he and your father had
some kind of falling out  that's all i know
isn't there some way we can find out more
this is the first interesting thing about dad since
well  this is the first interesting thing about dad
honey  trust me  i've learned the hard way
when it comes to duncan family drama
stay out
are there any other surprise relatives
you want to tell me about
no
no
today's all burnt toast
running late  and dad says
has anybody seen my left shoe
i close my eyes  take a bite
grab a ride  laugh out loud
there it is up on the roof
i've been there  i've survived
so just take my advice
hang in there  baby
things are crazy
but i know your future is bright
hang in there  baby
there is no maybe
eveything turns out all right
sure life is up and down
but trust me  it comes back all around
you're gonna love who you turn out to be
hang in there  baby
good luck charlie  s01e10  take mel out to the ballgame
great news  mom  i like charlie now
well  finally  what happened
we were in the park and this photographer
thought that charlie was the cutest baby ever
he offered to pay her 100 dollars to use her as a model
who knew  she's actually good for something
besides drooling and pooping
"walter louper photography
specializing in dogs  cats and babies "
forget it  i'm not exploiting my baby
but we don't have a dog or a cat
mom  come on
this could be a big break for charlie
p j   charlie is not getting a job before you do
well  the photographer didn't offer to shoot me
ha  you don't have to have a modeling job
any job will do  come here
man  this conversation sure took an ugly turn
anyway  we will not be needing this
i knew we should've done it my way
what was your way
we don't tell mom we're doing the photo shoot
we go ahead and do it anyway and split the money
when did you come up with that
at the park
i told you when the girls' cross country team ran by
oh  yeah
what were we talking about again
hi  charlie  teddy here
so it turns out there's a duncan family mystery
yeah  yesterday i found out we have an uncle mel

well  only if you pull your pants over your face
because that is a belt

okay  well  if you go to the rest home with me
i will go to the mall with you
okay  but i have to warn you
my grandpa was in a rest home

cute story
well  here you go
your mom has very nice    printing

what happened between you and dad
after this inning
hot stuff coming through
ivy  ivy  what is all this
it's your fault for giving me a credit card

because they stink  like a sewer  they stink
hey  control your grandpa  he's scaring my kids
hey  your kids stink
sorry  he didn't mean that
i'm sure your kids smell awesome
okay  uncle mel  why don't you just sit down
and enjoy a nice  quiet hot dog
i'd love a hot dog  hey  weiner  have a weiner
no
are you gonna do something about him or should i
yeah  i said i'd handle it and it would be
a lot easier without your helpful suggestions
oh  well  here's a helpful suggestion
take him out of here or i take you out of here
oh  you shouldn't have said that
'cause now ivy's about to get out of her chair
t  hold my ring
okay  can we all just chill
hey  losers  get a load of this
no
oh no  we're on the jumbo screen
are we almost done
'cause if not  we're kinda getting into overtime
is that a problem
not for us
but for mom  i think it's gonna cost you
exactly what i was thinking  little brother
i'm gonna run this by the boss
mom  what are you doing here
i live here
but you're not supposed to be back yet
well  i finished everything i needed to do    got the car washed
did the grocery shopping  went to the bank
what is that flashing coming from the living room
oh  it's probably a fuse you might want to check
the fuse box out in the garage
get out  shut it down
what's going on
mom's home  she's really home
get out
what's going on here
p j  you want to take that one
no  i'll take the next one
i can't believe you two disobeyed me
oh  my poor little baby
i love it    mom and baby
look  please stop  just get out
but you look so good together
no  seriously    get out
perfect  just like that
like that
yes
and how about a little of this
great
wait  get my better side
wow  mom  you're a natural
yeah  the camera loves you
you two are so grounded
then the police politely asked us to leave
at which point uncle mel invited them to kiss something
that had been on the jumbo screen
oh  good  all right
now you know why i wanted you to stay away from your uncle mel
the guy's a maniac  especially when it comes to baseball
yeah  that would've been useful information
you know what  just go to bed
i really don't want to talk about this anymore
well  there is one more thing
i should tell you about uncle mel
yeah  what's that
he's in the living room
what
you have to talk to him
no  i don't  i don't  i've got nothing to say to him
what is this all about  anyway  why won't anybody tell me
because it's ancient history
all right  it's done it's forgotten about
i've moved on  now get that old fart out of my house
be right back
so dad says welcome
he doesn't want to talk to me  does he
well  i don't want to talk to him either
and you can tell him i said that
i'll be right back
uncle mel says he loves you
really
uncle mel said that
yeah  he said something like that
it's so long since i've been in the living room
well  when is he gonna leave the living room
okay  uncle mel wants to sort this thing out
maybe you should start
i think he should start
i'll be right back
dad says he loves you
hogwash
and he thinks it would help
if you told me what this feud was about
when your father was 10 years old  i was his baseball coach
oh  now i get it
what's that supposed to mean
well  you get a little bit too excited about baseball
i share my opinions
anyway  i gave him some constructive criticism
you said i swung like a girl
i was sugar coating it  you swung like a baby girl
hey  we're talking  this is a start
you humiliated me in front sof the entire team
i was trying to make you better
well  you didn't yell at any of the other kids
because i didn't care about any of the other kids  fathead
whoa  did you hear that
before the fathead part
he said he cared about you
i was trying to make you tough
and i guess
sometimes i got a little carried away
i'm sorry
we have an apology  hey  dad
well  maybe sometimes i was a little oversensitive
and i'm sorry
and a return apology
now you know what we do in this family after we fight
i'm hoping eat
we hug
hugging's for girls
baby girls
that's
i gotta tinkle
be back in 20 minutes
right over there
come here
you did good  kid  thank you
yeah  well you guys are always saying
how important family is
yes  yes  it is
he just walked into the'
i'm afraid so
hey  mel  that's not a bathroom
it is now
well  charlie  here i am waiting for you and mom
'cause mom said i have to see this  whatever this is
here we come
look at you two
why are you dressed like that
well  we had a casting
in the professional modeling business
that's what an audition is called
a casting
so you're a professional model now
oh  don't act surprised  teddy
i think we all knew this day was coming
she's a model now
if i knew raising parents was gonna be this hard
never would've done it
but soon enough it'll be your turn
so good luck  charlie
p j  duncan  here to see my parents
hey  mom
i'll be right with you  p j
i'm in the middle of class  we're really gonna push it
we're gonna touch our toes
and touch your toes
or your knees
you know what  just do the best you can
okay  now we're gonna squat
oh  take it down  gotta feel the burn
here we go
oh  no
bob  i'm locked again
bob
"swanee river"
here  mom  i gotcha
oh  thank you  p j
oh  sorry i'm late  guys
that was a long walk in from the parking lot
that's what happens when you don't do the squats
