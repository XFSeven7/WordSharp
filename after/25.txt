hi  honey
i got off work early and made your favorite dinner
i am so lucky to be married to you
as my mom always says to my dad
yes  you are
hi  honey
how's my beautiful wife today
wait  but
 but i thought     hi  honey
oh  you made brandon's favorite dinner
wait a minute  am i married to you
or you or you
yes
you couldn't decide which one of us was the love of your life
 so you married all of us   but that's crazy
i'll tell you what's crazy
it's 10 years later and i haven't grown at all
ivy  i'm up here at the ski lodge and and i met
this psychic who said i'd meet the love of my life
and so i met the guy
but then i met another guy
and then you won't believe who showed up
and so that makes three guys and and i need your help
oh sorry  this is teddy
when we get to the top  mind if i go first
you're kinda slow
excuse me
i've seen you board  and i've also seen my grandma board
kind of the same thing
 better than you   oh yeah
care to put your money where your mouth is
nope  last time i did that  a quarter froze to my lip
i mean do you want to make a bet
100 bucks says i beat you to the bottom
oh  it is on
the only reason you won is because
i hit a wicked patch of ice
then i guess you have no problem making it double or nothing
bring it
hey  look what charlie got
a present from that little toddler she has a crush on
 that's nice   i guess some men know how to treat their women
 you seen my luggage   yes  i have
 do you want to tell me where it is   sure
it's in your room
your  i new  i  room
why do i have a new room
well  because you and i are not legally married
and since it would apparently inconvenience you
to marry me again  you'll be lodging elsewhere
 oh come on   mm hmm
as a single woman
i don't feel comfortable having a strange man in my room
 amy duncan  you're a piece of work   ah ah
amy blankenhooper
you're going back to your maiden name
yes  i am  mm hmm
to tell you the truth  i've always preferred blankenhooper
yeah  what is it you like most about it
that people laugh so hard when they say it
or just that they can't spell it
get out  bob
hey  t
oh  ivy  i'm so glad you made it
you can lower your arms now
don't you think i would if i could
why do you have so many layers on
ivy doesn't do cold
so what's the big emergency
well  i met this psychic
oh  so you did say psychic
i thought we were in a bad cell zone
anyway  she said i'd come face to face
with the love of my life on this trip
and so far i've met brandon  justin and
 spencer   spencer
the two timing dog that cheated on you
 yep  that's the one   no
that's not the one
i mean  so who are these other boys
oh  there    there's one right now
i that's justin   i
oh  he's cute  so what do you know about him
that he's cute
well  i've only had one day
all i need is one minute
yo  justin
teddy  hi
hi  justin  this is my best friend ivy
how you doing  justin  you a skier
 yeah  i sure am   oh great
one other thing
 does your family have money   ivy
sorry
i actually didn't catch your answer
that's 'cause i didn't throw it yet
 p j    i need to borrow some money
what did you say
i need to borrow some money  stop that
 all right  me first   okay
i lost a bet and i need  200
i need  300  did you know hotels charge for room service
sure  everyone knows that
did you know i'm a terrible snowboarder
sure  everyone knows that
 we really should have talked earlier   yeah
man  where are we gonna find  500
attention  guests  this is your last chance
to sign up for the ice dancing contest
grand prize  500
that was convenient
just one problem    we don't know how to ice dance
remember this is an amateur contest
you do not need to know how to ice dance
you're so funny  hi  bob  didn't see you there
 who's your friend   some guy i met
ah  what's his name
well  it's not duncan  that's for sure
yep  been there  done that
you know two can play at this game
hiya  doll
i don't want to play this game
so you want to be a chef and a swimsuit model
that's a good combination
how do we know he's qualified
can you cook us something
 with your shirt off   ivy
she's just kidding
unless you want to
hi  mommy
i'm in the lobby with some girls
no  they're not prettier than you
okay  0 for 2
so if it's not brandon and it's not justin
 then that means     no  don't say spencer
it cannot be spencer  i don't want it to be spencer
i was gonna say that means
i came all the way up here for nothing
but yeah  let's keep it on you
so that's ice dancing  huh
it looked hard
maybe we should go back to the lobby
and see if there's another  500 contest
come on  we can do this
we just gotta work out a routine
um  okay  put your hands in the teapot position
like they did in the video
like this
 what's so funny   nothing  i'm ticklish
well  don't be
 let's try it again   okay
 stop that   i can't help it
gabe  come on  if we're gonna do this thing
we have to pull together  we have to work harder
than we've ever worked in our lives
we have to push ourselves to the absolute limit
and beyond
the contest is at 4 00
i won't kid you  it's going to be a rough hour and a half
what an awesome view
i totally agree
oh no
spencer  are you following me
well  kinda  yeah
um  there's something i really need to tell you face to face
no no  don't say face to face
 why not   look  it's complicated
can we just please sit here quietly until the ride's over
just no more talking
the ski lift stopped
i hear talking
one and two and three and four
and arms arms  hands hands
and spin  two three four
and sell it
not bad
well yeah
but is "not bad" gonna win us  500
you're right
we need a special move
a move so good it'll blow the judges away
a move i call "the cyclone of awesomeness "
what's that
i don't know  i just like the name
maybe we could try that move we saw on the video
you mean the one where the guy threw the girl in the air
can we just say the big one and the little one
fine  now put your hand on top of mine like the girl did
little one
all right  now i'm gonna throw you and you spin
and while you're up there
try to do as much twirling as you can
out  face  cheeks
smile  back  spin
and throw
whoa
i didn't see much twirling
it could be because you threw me into the wall
try it again
ready
out  face  cheeks
 smile     what is going on in here
brother stuff
oh look  charlie  there's your little friend
honey  when you let the guy go
you keep the toys
 mr  duncan   miss blankenhooper
well  hello again
listen  you should know that i'm happily married
well  not happily
and not actually married
tell shirley all about it
look  we found out that our marriage wasn't legal
and now we're fighting
because i don't want to get remarried on vacation
i think she's being completely unreasonable
look  doll  nobody ever said love was reasonable
and a little romantic gesture goes a long way
thanks
that's actually pretty good advice
if it doesn't work out  you know where to find me
okay  i'm walking away now
mm mm mm
mama like
look  now that we're stuck up here
you have to listen to me
but  spencer  we've already talked about everything
i miss you  teddy
i miss us
i came up here because i want you back
no  you cannot be the one
the one what
well  i met this psychic
and she told me i'd come face to face
with the love of my life on this trip
and i keep running into you and
everything else she predicted came true  but
just i'm so confused
i'm not  teddy  when i found out you were coming up here
something told me i had to see you
 i don't know   i do
and you do too
we're moving again
yes  we are
are you kidding me

there are only two teams
so you're following me
attention  guests

p j  and gabrielle duncan
it's gabe  i'm a dude
stop that
one  two  three  four

out  face  cheeks
smile

what's so important
i don't know  front desk says they needed to see you

and our kiss
well  you know how my mom said
that every time she kisses my dad she falls in love again

 go get his number   i'm on it
well  charlie
we're back home from your first family vacation
where you also went to your first wedding
yep  mom and dad renewed their vows of love
okay  who is shirley
and why is she calling here  bob
i am in the phone book

everything's pretty much back to normal
how many times have i told you
you've gotta land the triple lutz
you're killing me
that's it  i quit
where am i supposed to find another partner
small enough to throw
good luck  charlie
i hear sometimes these things get stuck
when we get to the top  mind if i go first
i've seen you ski  you're not very good
i could flick you off here like a booger
a psychic told me i'd meet the love of my life on this trip
did your family had money
i don't even know what money is
