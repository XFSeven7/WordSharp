called "fun with science " and guess what
the title was a lie
oh  hey  you want to check out
the trailer for the new vampire movie "dusk"
oh  you know i do
those vampires are so cute
there must be something about being undead that gives you rock hard abs
oh  hey  we should go to the first show
which is
oh  thursday at midnight
my mom would never let me out that late on a school night
just do what i do    tell your mom how cool she is
then you get whatever you want
that really works
how do you think i got that leather skirt i can't sit down in
i don't know  i mean  i'm not a very good liar
that scarf looks really great on you
doesn't it
yeah  i could totally pull this off
i hope we end up being lab partners  dude
i don't
what's that supposed to mean
don't make me say it
oh  yes  i got walter
oh  great
you get the president of the science club
and i'm stuck with this dumb lug van brundt
what did you just say
i said
i'd    i'd love to give a hug to van brundt
don't
okay
lab partner buddy
my phone number
call me when it's done
you got it  big guy
don't call me big guy
very sorry
hey  great news    we're partners
yeah  there's no need for us to get together
i'll do the project and put both of our names on it
oh  i love you  man
hey  whatcha doing  mom
oh  just going through the spices  tossing out the old ones
oh  that is so cool
it is
well  maybe it's just the way you do it
well  i do have a system
it's alphabetical
okay  cardamom comes before cinnamon which comes before coriander
whoa  i could listen to you talk about spices all day
 then we go onto dill      okay
then it kind of jumps around to fennel
but instead  how about we talk about clothes
like that awesome new top you're wearing
you like this  honey  i've had it forever
and i especially love that splash of color on your shoulder
what  that
i think that's charlie's puke
let's talk about your shoes
hello  oh  hey  ivy
you want me to come over
oh no  sorry  i'd rather hang out with my mom
okay  talk to you later  bye
are you sick  are you gonna puke on me too
no  why
you'd rather hang out with me than ivy
mom  does cinnamon come before coriander
that is the sweetest thing you have ever said to me
my little wooskie
i'm a happy happy horse
happy happy happy horse
happy happy happy horse
yeah  sounds like happy horse needs some new batteries
no  i can't get that stupid song out of my head
all right  all right  you know what
let's build us a helicopter
and the fun begins with the instruction manual
dad  do we have to
yes  we have to  oh  you know what
we should start with the "before you begin" pamphlet
oh  and there's a dvd  which we will watch
after the pamphlet and the instruction manual
dad  how long is this gonna take
oh  not long  oh  hey  look at this
oooh  a "before you watch the dvd" card
if there's anything better
than a homemade facial with my "bmf "
i haven't heard of it
  b m f      best mom forever
oh my gosh  i would be smiling  but my face is going to crack
what's going on
oh  just a couple girlfriends hanging out
what  is ivy here
no  i'm talking about me and mom
we've been hanging out all afternoon
we went to the mall  we went shopping
then we did some other stuff i can't tell you about
yeah  well  i didn't ask
that's good 'cause we're not gonna tell you
yeah  i'm gonna be in the other room
oh  dad  i actually need to ask you guys about something
is it okay if ivy and i go to a midnight movie on thursday
thursday  no way  it's a school night
bob  honey  you don't understand  okay
this isn't just any movie  this is "dusk "
  what's that    hello
the movie about the vampires
the prequel to "dawn "
so lame
all right  you know what  you wanna let her go  let her go
  okay  thank you  daddy  thank you  girlfriend    teddy
call me
what's that in your hair
it's called glitter  get with it  grandpa
emmett  thank you
i can't believe i have to do this whole chemistry project by myself
stupid van brundt
hey  don't call him stupid
that's an insult to stupid people everywhere
that idiot can't even count to 10
which  coincidentally  is the number of years he's going to be in high school
guess that's my phone
oh  that's weird  it says i have a call in progress
you probably sat on it and butt dialed someone
hello  nobody there
must have gotten voicemail
who'd you dial
van brundt  van brundt
he's gonna hear everything we just said about him
you mean he's going to hear everything you just said about him
we were both talking about him  emmett
stop saying my name
  and hang up the phone     yes
  hey    hey
so did my evil plan work  did you butter up your mom
like popcorn at a midnight movie
what was that
oh  it's just my phone  it's always making weird noises
so how'd you do it
oh  it was so painful
i i had to spend the whole day with her pretending she was cool   i
i longest day of my life   i
but it was all worth it
because we're going to see "dusk"
"when the sun goes down  his fangs come out "
and his shirt comes off
it was all just a big trick so
teddy could get permission to see that vampire movie
bob  she thinks i'm just as uncool as i thought my mom was
it's the great uncool circle of life
well  honey  if it helps  i think you're cool
it doesn't
all right  so what's the punishment going to be
no movie  grounded for a week
too easy
mama's going to get even
you know nothing good ever happens
when you start calling yourself "mama "
mama doesn't care
there he is
guess we should just go in there and get it over with
man  i hate getting beat up
you've been beat up before
no  but i've heard bad things
hey  duncan  get in here
how are you doing on our project
okay
that's all you wanted to talk about
oh  i'm sorry
i love what you've done with your hair
so    heard any interesting phone messages lately
no  mrs  jeter caught me texting in class and took my phone away
  ohh     what
that    that's terrible  don't you hate it when people just take your phone
and put it    where exactly
it's in her desk  i'm getting it back at the end of the day
i'm tired of talking
  hey    hey
aren't you home from school a little early
we've got a helicopter to fly
and i'm only missing p e
and english and math
all right  let's get this bird in the air
  whoa    how'd you do that
  i don't know    is it voice activated
uh    stop
down
  no     whoa
you must have put it together wrong
no no  that's impossible  i followed all the instructions
  where's the remote     i don't know
oh  dad  do something
i am    i'm making a run for it
okay  the coast is clear  let's go
just get the phone and get out of here
okay  i got it  let's go
i oh  jeez   i

baby monitor
stupid technology
