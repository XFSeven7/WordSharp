interrogating
state your name  please

tell me about the incident
well  there's this girl
um  in my class
i i saw her at the track meet   i
  you're  uh  violet  right
  that's me
i i sort of knew her
but she'd changed   i
i relaxed
she was more sure of herself   i
i cool  cute   i
i i asked her out to a movie   i
so  friday
  friday
  friday
i and i went to watch
the track meet   i
i not long after  this thing
happened in the parking lot   i
behold  the underminer
i am always beneath you
but nothing is beneath me
i as if things aren't
weird enough   i
i i look over
and i see these boots   i
you two  stay here
wait
should we be doing this
it is still illegal
i they looked
like superheroes   i
  we're gonna lose him
  oh  all right
one of you patrol
the perimeter
keep the crowds
back and safe
the other
watch after jack jack
but i thought we were
gonna go with
you heard your mother
trampoline me
i call perimeter
you're not
going anywhere
you little
maggoty creep
i i see my chance
to get out of there   i
i but there's something familiar
about one of the kids' voices   i
i the girl  she's upset  i
i and she throws down
her mask     i
i and it's her   i
oh  tony
hi
uh  this isn't
what you think it is
i it was just getting
too freaky   i
i i couldn't handle it
and ran off   i
i feel kinda bad about it
maybe i should've said
"hi" or something
it's not her fault
superheroes are illegal
and it's not like
i don't like strong girls
i'm pretty secure
manhood wise
what is that
have you told anyone else
about this  your parents
no  they'd only think
i was hiding something
  you know what i mean
  sure  kid
i like this girl  mr  dicker
i'm supposed to go out
with her friday night
now  things are just
gonna be weird
i wish i could forget
i ever saw her in that suit
you will  kid
you will
come on
consider yourself undermined
ooh
  underminer
  we meet again    huh
oh  great
now  he's on the agenda
incredible
meet jack hammer
buh bye
no  no  no  no  no  no
everybody  stay back
okay  stay back
you're not sticking me
with babysitting
i can't steer it or stop it
and the underminer's escaped
we'll have to stop it
bob  the monorail
frozone  yeah
we have to stop
this thing
before it gets
to the overpass
i'll try to keep it away
from the buildings
hey  lady
thank you so much
young man
what
violet
ahh
stop
everybody  stop
  heads up  dad
  dash
violet
who's watching jack jack
dash is watching him
violet  here  you take him
it's headed for city hall
mom needs help
they're out in public again
this is our chance
follow them
follow frozone
bob  help me
with the boiler
that should do it
what are you kids doing
get out of here
this thing's gonna blow
there's no time
we did it
freeze  supers
oh  what did we do
excuse me  mr  zone
sorry  but i'm not
really supposed to be here
which seems wrong
doesn't it
perhaps you'd be interested
in changing that law
i superheroes including frozone   i
i mr  incredible
and elastigirl     i
i caused further damage
to the city   i
i the underminer
remains at large   i
we didn't start
this fight
well  you didn't
finish it either
did you stop the underminer
from inflicting more damage
no
did you stop him
from robbing the banks
  no
  did you catch him
  no
  the banks were insured
we have infrastructure
in place
to deal
with these matters
if you had simply
done nothing
everything would now be
proceeding
in an orderly fashion
you'd have preferred
we do nothing
without a doubt
you weren't much help
do you want
out of the hole
first you gotta
put down the shovel
well  that went poorly
dad  this is probably
not the best time
to tell you about this
but something else
happened today with a kid
and my mask
oh  hey  rick
violet thinks a friend
of hers  a kid named tony
might have seen her in the
outfit  without her mask
  talkative type
  don't know
last name is rydinger
tony rydinger
i'll check it out
bob  helen
a word
if you don't mind
uh  the program's been
shut down
what
politicians don't
understand people
who do good simply
because it's right
it makes 'em nervous
they've been gunning
for supers for years
today was all they needed
anyway
i'm done
i'm afraid two more
weeks in the motel
is the best
i can do for ya
it ain't much
you've done plenty  rick
we won't forget
well  it has been
a great honor
working with
you good people
thanks for everything
and good luck
yeah  you  too
did you wash your hands
with soap
did you dry them
what  is this all vegetables
who ordered all vegetables
i did  they're good and
you're going to have some
are we going to
talk about it
  what
  the elephant in the room
  what elephant
  i guess not then
you're referring
to today
yeah  what's the deal
with today
we all made mistakes
for example
you kids were supposed
to watch jack jack
babysitting  while you guys
did the important stuff
we talked about this
you're not old enough to
decide about these things
we are old enough
to help out
yeah
isn't that what
you tell us  dad
yeah  well  "help out" can
mean many different things
but we're supposed to help
if there's trouble
  well  yeah  but
  aren't you
  glad we helped today
  yeah  i know but
you said that you were
proud of us
well  yeah  i was  am
we wanna fight
bad guys
no  you don't
you said things
were different now
and they were
on the island
but i didn't mean
that from now on
so now  we've gotta go back
to never using our powers
it defines who i am
we're not saying
you have
  what
  someone on tv said it
can we just eat
the dinner  while it's hot
did we do
something wrong
  yes
  no
we didn't do
anything wrong
superheroes are illegal
whether it's fair or not
that's the law
the law should be fair  what
are we teaching our kids
to respect the law
even when the law
is disrespectful
if laws are unjust  there
are laws to change them
otherwise  it's chaos
which is exactly
what we have
i just thought
it was kinda cool
  what was
  fighting crime as a family
it was cool
but it's over
the world is what it is
we have to adapt
are things bad
things are fine
may i be excused
how much longer
in the motel  dad
  uh
  not much longer  honey
what are we
gonna do
i don't know
maybe dicker
will find something
dicker is done  bob
any thought we had about being
supers again is fantasy
one of us
has gotta get a job
one of us
you did a long stint
at insuricare
hated every minute of it
i know
it was hard on you
maybe it's my turn
in the private sector
and you take care
of the kids
no  i'm doing this
i need to do this
you know where my suit
and ties are
burned up when
the jet destroyed
our house
yeah
we can't count
on anyone else now  bob
it's just us
we can't wait for
no lifeguard on duty
swim at your own risk
oh  where'd you go today
i noticed
you missed all the fun
don't be mad because
i know when to leave a party
i'm just as illegal
as you guys
besides  i knew the cops
would let you go
yeah  in spite
of bob's best efforts
yeah  yeah  yeah
i heard
the program shut down
how much longer
are you in this motel
two weeks
now  you know
the offer still stands
you're very generous
but there are five of us
we wouldn't do that
to you and honey
well  door's always open
you know
the news isn't all bad
while you guys
were being detained
i was approached by a dude
who represents this tycoon
  winston deavor
  wants to talk
with me  with you two
about hero stuff
i checked him out
he's legit
trained under dicker
he wants to meet
ah  jeez
more superhero trouble
we just came from
the police station  lucius
  when
  tonight  i'm going there now
you enjoy
i'm sitting this one out
he wants
all three of us
honey  let's just at least
hear what he has to say
you got the address
i'll meet you guys there
go in our supersuits
yeah
might wanna wear
the old supersuits
got a feeling
he's nostalgic
where are you going
the fresh air
is especially good tonight
if jack jack
wakes up
i know the drill
your security badges
please  this way
hey  listen
you're my biggest fan
good to see you
i'm your biggest fan
shoot
i love superheroes
the powers  the costumes
the mythic struggles
winston deavor
you can call me win
genuine pleasure
to meet you
  frozone
  it's good to see you
  elastigirl
  nice to meet you
  mr  incredible
  hello
i ♪ mr  incredible
incredible  i
i ♪ incredible  i
i ♪ catching the bad guys
pow  pow  pow ♪  i
i ♪ who's the cat
who's always chill  i
i ♪ when survival odds
are close to nil  i
i ♪ frozone
frozone  i
i ♪ frozone  i
yeah
can't tell you what a thrill this is
and this
oh  hello there  superheroes
i'm so sorry i'm late
is my tardy sister
evelyn
and i'm scolding myself so
you don't have to  winston
spectacular
my father was so proud
that i was even remotely
connected to you guys
he used to call you
the last line of defense
he was
your top supporter
he donated
to superhero causes
i he raised money  i
i for the dynaguy statue
in avery park   i
i he got to know
many supers personally   i
i even installed a phone  i
i with direct lines
to gazerbeam and fironic     i
i in case of emergencies   i
i he loved that
showed it off to everyone   i
he was heartbroken
when you were all forced
to go underground
father believed
the world
would become more dangerous
without you
he didn't know
how right he was
i there was a break in   i
i my father called gazerbeam   i
i the direct line   i
i no answer   i
i he called fironic  no answer   i
i superheroes had just been
made illegal     i
i the robbers discovered him
on the phone     i
i and shot him   i
so
it must've been hard
especially for mother
she died a few months later
heartbreak
if superheroes had not been
forced underground
it never would've happened
or dad could've taken
mom to the safe room
as soon as he knew
there was trouble
i disagree strongly
but we're not going
into it right now
the point is
nobody expected us
to be able to actually
run dad's company
but with evelyn as designer
and myself as operator
uh  we threw ourselves
into building devtech
into what it is today
a world class
telecommunications company
bigger than ever
perfectly positioned to make
some wrong things right
hence  this meeting
let me
ask you something
what is the main reason
you were all
forced underground
  ignorance
  perception
take today for example
with the underminer
difficult situation
you were faced with a
lot of hard decisions
oh  tell me about it
i can't
because i didn't see it
neither did anyone else
so  when you fight bad
guys like today
people don't see the fight
or what led up to it
they see what politicians
tell them to see
they see destruction
and they see you
so  if we wanna change
people's perceptions
about superheroes
we need you
to share your perceptions
with the world
  how do we do that
  with cameras
i we need you to share your
perceptions with the world   i
i how do we do that   i
we embed
tiny cameras  like those
into your supersuits
wow  so small
and the picture
is outstanding
thanks
designed 'em myself
we've got
resources  lobbyists
worldwide connections
and very important
insurance
insurance is key
all we need now are the
super est superheroes
it needs you three
come on
help me make all supers
legal again
this sounds great
let's get this going
what's my first assignment
that enthusiasm is golden
now hold on to it
but for our first move
well  elastigirl
is our best play
better than me
i mean  she's good
really  a credit to her
you know  you know
with great respect
let's not test the whole
"insurance will pay 
for everything" idea
on the first go 'round  okay
wait a minute  you're saying what
i'm messy
well  evelyn did
a cost benefit analysis
comparing all your last
five years of crime fighting
before going underground
and elastigirl's numbers
are self explanatory
well  it's not
a fair comparison
heavyweight problems
need heavyweight solutions
of course
we're gonna solve
all kinds
of problems together
after the perfect launch
with elastigirl
so  what do you say
what do i say
i don't know
what do you mean
you don't know
a few hours ago  you were
saying it was over
and being a superhero
was a fantasy
now  you get the offer
of a lifetime
and you don't know
it's not that simple  bob
i wanna protect the kids
so do i
from jail  bob
and how do you do that
by turning down a chance
to change the law
that forces them to hide
what they are
they haven't decided what they are
they're still kids
kids with powers
which makes them supers
whether they decide to
use those powers or not
this will benefit them
it's not a good time
to be away
dash is having trouble
with homework
vi is worried
about her first date
with that boy she likes
tony
and jack jack
jack jack
what's wrong with him
okay  nothing's wrong
with jack jack
but even a normal baby
needs a lot of attention
i'm just not sure
i can leave
of course you can leave
you've got to
so that i
we can be supers again
so our kids can have
that choice
so you can have
that choice
all right  yes
so i can have
that choice
and i would do a great job
regardless of what deavor's
pie charts say or whatever
but they want you
and you'll do a great
job
too
well  that
was excruciating to watch
i can't lie to you
it's nice to be wanted
flattering  you know  but
but what's the choice
one  do this right
get well paid
we're out of the motel
and things get better
for all supers
including our kids
or two
i find a job in two weeks
or we're homeless
you know
it's crazy  right
to help my family
i gotta leave it
to fix the law
i gotta break it
you'll be great
i know i will
but what about you
we have kids
i'll watch the kids
no problem
  easy
  easy  huh
you're adorable
well  if there is
a problem
i'll drop this thing
and come right back
you won't need to
i got it
you go do this thing
do it so
i can do it better
deavor here
this is elastigirl
i'm in
mr  deavor
it's wonderful
i but it's too generous   i
nonsense  that's the
least we can do
we're partners now
can't have my partners
living in a motel
but whose house
is it a house
i it's my house
i have several   i
i i'm not using that one
stay as long as you need   i
i don't know
what to say
how about "thanks"
this is our new house
okay  easy  tiger
it's being loaned to us
this is homey
look at this place
deavor bought it from
an eccentric billionaire
who liked to come and go
without being seen
so the house has
multiple hidden exits
good thing
we won't stand out
wouldn't want to attract
any unnecessary attention
it's got
a big yard
isn't this a bit much
near a forest
would you rather be
at the motel
and a pool
what exactly
is mom's new job
the important thing is
we're out of the motel
i like mom's new job
oh  ho  ho
whoa
whoa
well  check out
the water features
  oh
  wow
wicked cool
hey  dash  stop it
  not the couch  stop it
  no  dash
stop
  don't touch the buttons
  the couch
  dash
  no
no  no
oh  no
oh  boy
this isn't me
i'm not all dark
and angsty
i'm elastigirl
i'm  you know
flexible

alexander galbaki

'cause you're gonna
hear from her
this note came with it
what

elasticycle  i didn't
know you had a bike

i ♪ stretching her  i
no theme songs
or i'll turn this bus
right around
look at that
new urbem
you wanna make a big
crime fighting statement
you go where
the crime is big
strange thing to be
excited about  winston
it's like
a superhero's playground
no sugar bombs
on my watch
where's mom
she's up and out
she's at her new job
doing hero work
but i thought superheroes
were still illegal
they are  for now
so mom is getting paid
to break the law
she's not breaking
she's an advocate
for superheroes
it's a new job
so  mom is going out
illegally
to explain why
she shouldn't be illegal
hey    hey
the bus is here
whoa  grab your stuff quickly
go on  get on the
put your homework
in your pack
bye bye
we're gonna get along
just fine
'cause you don't ask any hard questions
i all right  all locations   i
i we need to know
where you want us   i
i stand by   i
seems strange
to wait for crime
relax
you're smack in the middle
of the worst crime area
in the city  it's perfect
it's a superhero's
playground
i "it's a superhero's
playground " right   i
you know
after we went underground
my husband used to listen
to a police scanner
waiting for something
to happen
and i got mad at him
for it
oh  i'm such a hypocrite
   i all units   i
  something's up
i we've been picking up
some chatter about  i
i potential disruptions to the
hovertrain's opening ceremony   i
   i disruption or threat   i
   i both   i
i station's at fifty fourth
and nottingham   i
a potential threat
perfect
fifty fourth and nottingham
go  go  go
hey  vi  i want you
back here by 10 30
11 ish
10 ish
heading for 9 30 ish
10 30 ish it is
enjoy the movie
"in the county of noddoff
"the frubbers of freep
"are all giving in to
the sweet succor of sleep "
i we will
control the horizontal     i
i we will control the vertical   i
that's not the way you're
supposed to do it  dad
they want us
to do it this way
i don't know that way
why would they change math
  it's okay  dad
  math is math
i'll just wait for mom
to get back
what
she won't understand it
any better than i do
i the outer limits   i
"all over doozle dorf
"the fribbers of frupp
are going to sleep
"'cause they just
can't keep up
"all over doozle dorf
doozles are dozing
"eyelids so heavy
they're drooping
"closing  the point is
"everyone
everyone's hitting the sack
"everyone's getting the sleep
that they lack "
i mayors often brag
about their cities     i
i and i'm no exception   i
i and i'm willing to admit  i
i that new urbem
is not the only city     i
are you sure the police are
gonna be okay with this
i sure  you're making
life easy for them   i
they still haven't
forgiven us
for the last time we made
life easy for them
i know the chief of police
there won't be a problem
with all due respect
if you alone had handled
the underminer
things would have
been different
i i'm just saying   i
i    on budget
and ahead of schedule     i
i to launch our magnificent
new hovertrain   i
i it can get you
where you need to go  i

so first  you wanna put
all the numbers
by themselves on one side
you change the sign
that means a plus becomes
a minus and a minus
you got it

oh  uh  hello
we're in a new house
i did write my address
on your locker
in permanent ink
oh  is that what that is
did you forget
forget what
that's funny
points for funny
oh  was it
the weird outfit
because there's a reason
i'm in a drama class
and they just wanna do
shakespeare
but they're like  "try to make
it relevant for the kids "
so  like  "oh  superheroes
kids love superheroes "
yeah  yeah  yeah
you wanna wear
one kind of tights
and then they're like
"no  wear these
other kind of tights "

i both sides just want the
best for their people   i
i we are so close to finally
getting peace in the region   i

when you defeat evil
okay
three  two
for over 15 years
superheroes have been
in hiding
forced into it
by a society
no longer willing
to support them
that may soon be changing
due to a growing movement
to bring the supers back
here  fresh on the heels
of her own
heroic save
of a runaway train
and sporting a new look
is the superhero  elastigirl
  welcome

good morning
he takes one look
at me in that suit
and decides to pretend

it's best that he forget
it's better for you  too
i can't tell you
how many memories
dicker's had to erase
over the years
when someone figured out
your mother's
or my identity
it was dicker

from tony's mind
i hate superheroes

because i didn't get him
screenslaver

all i did was play his game
and win this round
he's gonna want more
and as long as
he gets to play  he wins
one thing
i've learned in business
smell the flowers
they don't bloom that often
what do you want
on your tombstone
"she worried a lot"
all right
stop talking

huh
oh  wow  uh

wow
come on  get yourself
together  karen
hi  my superhero name
is voyd
i just wanna thank you
for  like  for being you
okay  what i can do
um  is this
yeah
that is impressive
very interdimensional
i felt like
an outcast before
but now  with you being
you  i feel like
yay  me
i flew them in
from all over
they've all been
in hiding
they have powers
secret identities
and names
they've given themselves
i'm screech
it's a pleasure
i've always considered you
the gold standard
for superheroes
well  thanks
you're too nice
i am called brick
nice to meet you  brick
uh  where are you from
wisconsin
oh  elastigirl
i assume your powers are
you know
zapping things electrically
charging things  bolts of
lightning  that kind of stuff
name's reflux
medical condition or
superpower  you decide
that's a little line
i say just to put
people at ease
hope i don't offend
oh  no  no  no
reflux  love it
well  i do look forward
to working with you
yes  that is impressive
keep practicing
ow
well  i'm beat  congratulations
big day
good night  ladies
i will see you tomorrow
good night
must be nice for you
being out front
after all this time
out front
well  it's been a while
since your superhero days
and even then
you were kind of
in mr  incredible's
shadow
nah  i beg to differ
i'm not    i'm not
saying you weren't big
no  you were
and are  a superstar
but you have the stage
to yourself now
and people have
to pay attention
oh  you mean  "it's a man's
world" and all that
well  what world
do you live in
your brother runs devtech
i don't want his job
i invent  he sells
i ask you  which of us
has the greater influence
which side of me
are you asking
the believer or the cynic
the cynic
would say selling
is more important
because the best sellers
have the most buyers
doesn't matter
what you're selling
it only matters
what people buy
this is true
if i discovered the
origin of the universe
my brother
would find a way
to market it as a
uh  foot massager
so  what would
the believer say
the believer would tell you
to make your mark
don't wait for permission
assert yourself
and impose your will
on the status quo
  sounds like my brother
  what
you sound like my brother
well  he's not wrong
there is an art
to getting a reaction
oh  i know
how to get him
  my brother
  no  screenslaver
you're tech savvy  i need
to lock onto a signal
and trace its origin
how fast can you
slap something together
and meet me
at the airport
airport
need to go
out of town  pronto
i can get your contraption
together by 5 00 a m
i need to get on tv
chad

this platter doesn't look
all that happy to me
it looks bored

tonight  we go now to
a special remote interview
with elastigirl
i how you feeling  chad   i
i you doing all right   i
i'm fine
the doctors checked me out
i have no memory
of the event
i gotta tell you
it's pretty strange
to see a recording
i of yourself the night before
and have no recollection   i
i i don't think
anyone needs to worry   i
i we've taken many precautions
tonight though   i
i where are you right now   i
on a case  in a secure
undisclosed location
i i wanna talk
about you     i
i starting with your save
of a runaway train   i
i here's an exclusive
unedited clip  i
i from your own suit cam   i
i roll the clip   i
i this thing's
really moving   i
i 100 and climbing
how much track is built   i
i about 25 miles   i
i the screenslaver
interrupts this program     i
i for an important announcement   i
i'll be damned  she knew
let's see
if your gadget works
i don't bother
watching the rest   i
gotcha
i elastigirl doesn't
save the day   i
i she only postpones her defeat   i
i and while she postpones
her defeat     i
i you eat chips and watch
her confront problems     i
i that you are too lazy
to deal with   i
i superheroes are part
of your brainless desire     i
i to replace true experience
with simulation   i
i you don't talk
you watch talk shows   i
i you don't play games
you watch game shows   i
i travel  relationships  risk     i
i every meaningful experience
must be packaged     i
i and delivered to you
to watch at a distance   i
i so that you can remain
ever sheltered     i
i ever passive     i
i ever ravenous consumers     i
i who can't bring themselves
to rise from their couches     i
i break a sweat
and participate in life   i
i you want superheroes
to protect you     i
i and make yourselves ever more
powerless in the process   i
i while you tell yourselves
you're being looked after   i
i that your interests
are being served   i
i and your rights
are being upheld   i
i so that the system can
keep stealing from you     i
i smiling at you all the while   i
i go ahead
send your supers to stop me   i
i grab your snacks
watch your screens   i
i and see what happens   i
i you are no longer in control   i
i i am   i
find anything
sorry
what happened
what happened is
you destroyed my evidence
what's going on
what did i do
what did you guys do to me
that's right  punk
blame the system
your tracker worked
like a charm  evelyn
i you're a genius   i
aw  shucks
i'm just the genius
behind the genius
hey  dad
we're doing fractions
and denismals and percentages
and i don't get 'em
aren't you
didn't we get all caught up
yeah  we were caught up
and now we're doing fractions
and percentages and demicels
decimals
i    the
addition of the incredibile   i
i the super car     i
i once driven by superhero
mr  incredible   i
i it's the kind of thing you buy
when you have everything else   i
they said it was
beyond repair
i hey
it was in perfect condition   i
you used to
drive that
they said it was destroyed
i long thought lost
or destroyed   i
i the famous car
turned up at private auction   i
they said it was
that's my car
stupid water feature
i this car is just loaded
with amazing gadgets   i
i care to demonstrate   i
i i'd love to
but we haven't figured out  i
i how to make them work yet   i
wow  it works
huh
what are you doing
this is not a toy
that's a rocket launcher
sweet  which one launches
the rocket
hey
this is not your car
it's not your car
either
it is so
it's the incredibile
  why's that guy have it
  he shouldn't
launch the rockets
launch the rockets
launch the rockets
  i'm not launching anything
  i wanna blow it up
do you think i want
an angry rich guy
coming after me right now
  when i'm trying not to
   i i'm not sure  i
   i what's happened here  mark   i
     distract your mother
i but everyone here
has scattered  i
i and i'm afraid i'll need
to move at any minute   i
rich guy got my car
so  you're not gonna
steal your car
back from the rich guy
what the heck is that
jack jack has powers
well  yeah  but
  you knew about this
  yeah
  why didn't you tell us
  i don't know
we're your kids  we need
to know these things
  did you tell mom
  no
  why not
  your mother is not
you'd want us to tell you
wouldn't you
  why would you not tell mom
  because i didn't wanna
what
  come on  man
  because it's not the time
  why
  because
so uncool
because i'm formulating  okay
i'm taking in information
i'm processing
i'm doing the math
i'm fixing the boyfriend
and keeping the baby
from turning into
a flaming monster
how do i do it
by rolling with
the punches  baby
i eat thunder
and crap lightning  okay
'cause i'm mr  incredible
not mr  so so
or mr  mediocre guy
mr  incredible
we should call lucius
no  i can handle it
there's no way i'm gonna
dada
i'm calling lucius
looks normal to me  when
did this start happening
since helen got the job
  i assume she knows
  are you kidding
i can't tell her
about this
not while she's doing
hero work
mama
i girls  come on   i
i leave the saving the world
to the men   i
   i i don't think so   i
  mama
i've got to succeed
so she can succeed
  so we can succeed
  i get it  bob
i get it  when was the
last time you slept
who keeps track of that
besides  he's a baby
i can handle it
i got this handled
so  you good then
you got everything
under control  right
what the
cookie  cha cha want a cookie
num num cookie
cha cha wanna num num
num num cookie  cookie
  you're not
  cookie
  oh  my god
  cookie
  dada  dada  dada
  whoa
okay  okay
so  he can still
hear you from the
from the other
dimension  yeah
that is freaky
i mean  that's not like
not like our other kids
no  it is not
full powers  totally random
so now  he's what
is he good
yeah  you'd think so
right
obviously  i can't keep
giving him cookies
  uh uh
  but if i stop
ahhh  he is freaking
again  he is freaking
no biting the daddy
  what the
  no biting
okay
i think i just need
a little bit of me time
then i'll be good to go
oh  you need
more than me time  bob
you need
major life realignment
on a number of levels
starting with
baby superfreak here
you need some solid
outside the box thinking
i galbaki   i
i elastigirl's supersuit
is by galbaki   i
i explain yourself   i
i oh  my god
you're worse than i thought   i
i it's the baby
i brought the baby   i
i oh  highly unusual   i
you look ghastly  robert
i haven't been sleeping
i broke my daughter
they keep changing math
we needed double a batteries
but i got triple a's
and now we still need
double a batteries
i put one red thing
in a load of whites
and now
everything's pink
and i think
we need eggs
done properly
parenting is a heroic act
done properly
i am fortunate that it has
never afflicted me
but you do not come to me
for eggs and batteries
robert
i design herowear
and elastigirl
must have a new suit
actually
it's jack jack
you also wish
a new suit for the baby
i would hardly classify
this as an emergency
well  he's a special case
worth studying
if i could just leave him
with you for a while
leave him  here
i am not a baby person
robert
i have no baby facilities
i am an artist
i do not involve myself in
the prosaic day to day to
day
fascinating
are you seeing this  robert
dada
oh  my god
yes
of course you can leave
the baby overnight
i'm sure filling in
for helen is challenging
and you are very tired
and the other children
need you
and miss you
and you must go to them
auntie edna will take care
of everything
so  drive safely and goodbye
i enjoy our visits
"auntie edna"
attention  attention
i wanna thank everyone
that came out tonight
in support of superheroes
and bringing them
back into society
you all made it happen
the need for this
has been made
crystal clear
in recent days
with bad actors
like the self proclaimed
screenslaver
threatening our peace
his reign was short  huh
and thanks to this woman
a great super  you love her
you missed her
welcome back  elastigirl
come on up here
don't be bashful
come on  get up here
i want you to have this
a memento
thanks  winston  evelyn
and everyone at devtech
i am forever in your debt
and thanks to all of you
your pressure
changed all the right minds
we've made amazing headway
in a very short time
which leads me to an
important announcement
just now
at a worldwide summit
leaders from
more than a hundred
of the world's
top countries
have agreed to make
superheroes legal again
we'll gather superheroes
and leaders
from all over
the planet
on our boat
the  i everjust     i
for a televised
signing ceremony at sea
now if you'll excuse us
we got a ship to catch
so good to see you
thanks for coming out
hey
hi  it's me  again
um  there's  uh  something
i've always wanted to ask you
yeah  how do you balance
the superhero stuff
with the life stuff
i know i can handle
the superhero stuff
uh huh  uh huh  oh
would you please
excuse me a moment
oh  yeah  okay  see you later
good talk
  hey  vi
  hey
where's jack jack
e's taking him
for a little bit
  edna is babysitting
  yeah
and you're okay with this
yeah  i don't know why
but yeah
i wanted to say
something to you
sorry about tony
i didn't think about dicker
erasing his memory
or about you having to pay
the price for a choice
you never made
it's not fair  i know
and then  i made it worse
at the restaurant
by trying to
anyway  anyway
i'm sorry
i'm used to knowing
what the right thing
to do is
but now
i'm not sure anymore
i just wanna be
a good dad
you're not good
you're super
are superheroes allowed
to drink on duty
i'm definitely not on duty
ignore the costume
i know
i should be up there
but i had to step away from
the grip and grins  you know
gotta get away to keep it pure
i know i do
what are you getting
away from
eh  you know  company stuff
my brother  mostly
but you love him
you two are this company
yin and yang
yeah  i invent the stuff
he's good at people
pleasing them  engaging them
figuring out what they want
i never know
what people want
what do you think
they want
ease
people will trade quality
for ease every time
it may be crap
but hey  it's convenient
yeah  kind of
like this case
what
the screenslaver
yeah  something's not
sitting right
it was too easy
that was too easy
wow
  funny
  what
look at that
one of screenslaver's monitors
is tuned into my suit cam
what
isn't the suit cam
closed circuit
it is
then how come
screenslaver has it
maybe he hacked it
so  he's sophisticated enough
to do that
but he has simple locks
on his doors
maybe he wanted you
to find him
he wanted to get caught
he wanted you to win
that makes no sense
he's a brilliant guy
if he's smart enough
to conceive
of technology like this
he's smart enough to think
of something to do with it
the guy we put in jail
delivered pizzas
so
einstein was
a patent clerk
look  you won
you got the guy who
wait  all screenslaver
needs to do
to hypnotize someone
is get a screen
in front of their eyes
but what if the screen
doesn't look like a screen
what if the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy
but he was controlled
by the screens
built into his glasses
you are good
i look  the robot   i
i it's taking off   i
i i'm not getting
a reading yet   i
   i press "fire"   i
   i now   i
i more power   i
i oh  i hope
this works  dad   i
i thought it was best
to just let you sleep
seventeen hours
how do you feel
super
   i you got it  dad   i
   i hurray   i
i can't tell you
how much i appreciate
you watching
jack jack for me  e
yes  i'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible
don't ask me
to do it again  darling
my rates are far too high
oh  uh
i am joking  robert
i enjoyed the assignment
he is bright
and i am stimulating
we deserve each other
your child is a polymorph
like all babies
he has enormous potential
it is not unknown
for supers
to have more than one
power when young
but this little one has many
yes  you have many powers
i understand
your lack of sleep
and coherency  robert
babies can be anything
and your child
is no exception
he has pure
unlimited potential  robert
he slept while i worked
in a creative fever
auntie edna stayed up
all night
making sure you look
fabulous in your many forms
what are you    you're
putting him in the
in the chamber  robert
he is part
of the demonstration
and will be fine
your challenge
is to manage a baby
who has
multiple powers
and no control
over them  yes
huh  that sums it up
i often work to music
and i noticed the baby
responds to it as well
specifically  mozart
i blended kevlar
with carbyne for
durability under duress
and cotton for comfort
interwoven with these fabrics
are a mesh of tiny sensors
that monitor the baby's
physical properties
oh  lord
what is he doing
well  it's mozart  robert
can you blame him
the important thing is that
the suit and tracker
anticipated the change
and alerted you
oh  no  cookies
i gotta get cookies
you do not need cookies
as i learned quite painfully
last night
any solution involving cookies
will inevitably result
in the demon baby
"combustion imminent"
what does that mean
it means fire  robert
for which the suit
has countermeasures
i suggest you extinguish
the baby's flames
before he trips
the sprinkler system
the flame retardant
is blackberry lavender
darling
effective  edible
and delicious
well  what do you know
that is useful
although  i have doubtlessly
exceeded your expectations
for a single night's work
the suit
and device contain
a few more features
we need to discuss
thanks again  e
for everything
how much
do i owe you for
pish posh  darling  your bill
will be covered by my fee
for being mr  incredible
elastigirl
and frozone's
exclusive designer
throughout the known universe
and until the end of time
but babysitting this one
i do for free  darling
i i would resist  i
i the temptation to stretch   i
i the temperature around you
is well below freezing   i
i try to stretch
and you'll break   i
i so  you're
the screenslaver   i
i yes and no   i
let's say
i created the character
and pre recorded
the messages
i does winston know   i
that i'm the screenslaver
of course not
can you imagine
what mr  free enterprise
would do
with my hypnosis technology
i worse than
what you're doing   i
i hey  i'm using
the technology  i
i to destroy
people's trust in it   i
like i'm using superheroes
i who did i put in jail   i
i pizza delivery guy   i
i seemed the right height
build   i
i he gave you
a pretty good fight   i
i i should say i gave you  i
i a pretty good fight
through him   i
i but it doesn't
bother you  i
i that an innocent man
is in jail   i
eh  he was surly
and the pizza was cold
i counted on you
that's why you failed
what
i why would you count on me
because i built you a bike   i
i because my brother
knows the words  i
i to your theme song   i
i we don't know each other   i
but you can
count on me anyway
i i am supposed to
aren't i   i
i because you have
some strange abilities  i
i and a shiny costume     i
i the rest of us are supposed
to put our lives  i
i into your gloved hands   i
i that's what
my father believed   i
when our home was broken into
my mother wanted to hide
begged my father
to use the safe room
but father insisted they call
his superhero friends
he died
pointlessly  stupidly
waiting for heroes
to save the day
i but why would you     i
   i your brother     i
  is a child
i he remembers the time  i
i when we had parents
and superheroes   i
i so  like a child
winston conflates the two   i
i mommy and daddy went away
because supers went away   i
i our sweet parents
were fools  i
i to put their lives
in anybody else's hands   i
i superheroes keep us weak   i
are you gonna kill me
nah
using you is better
you're gonna help me make
supers illegal
forever

i years of mandated
hiding and silence  i
have made us bitter
you bring us out
into the light
i only to clean up the messes  i
i your lack
of discipline creates   i
i your bodies
and your character are weak   i
i your promises are empty
and you will pay for it   i
i we no longer serve you   i
i we serve only us   i
i may the fittest survive   i
i well  we  um     i
i some very alarming
moments there     i

i thought last time

oh  sweetie
how could i be mad
i'm proud
not to break up
a tender moment
but where are we
is this devtech's ship
evelyn deavor
controls the screenslaver
and until a second ago  us
where's the crew
i collision detected
correct course   i
uh oh

why are the kids here
you didn't go to the house

those guys
what the
jack jack has powers
we know
fight now  talk later
jack jack

  you'll be safe here
safe  safe from what
where are the diplomats
the supers
still hypnotized
what have you done
evelyn  she's escaping
well  go after her
finish your mission
i can't just go
what about the kids
  jack jack  who's gonna
  mom
go  we've got this
voyd  come with me
i'll go shut down
the engine
i'll try to slow the
ship from the bow
wait  someone's missing
where's the crusher guy
strap in now
it's for your own good
no
this is
  we're too late
  get me up to the jet
hey  you did this
can you undo it
you want me to un crush
what  no one's ever
asked for that
no  to un crush is silly
why un crush
to get into the engine room
oh  forget it
we don't have enough time
what if i said
to un punch someone
what do you do
welcome aboard  elastigirl
i although
we haven't yet reached  i
i our cruising altitude     i
feel free to roam about
the cabin
or just relax
i and let the cabin roam
about you   i
i can't get
to the engine room
we gotta do something
because trying to
slow it down ain't working
hey  what about
turning the boat
the steering's
been destroyed
  dash means from the outside
  yeah
if we break off
one of the foils
and turn the rudder
we can veer the ship
away from the city
that might work
i'll turn the front
you turn the rear
using the rudder
that's underwater
how am i supposed to get
all right
come on  kids
dad  i know
this is going to work
but if it doesn't
and we crash
my shields are probably better
protection than the ship
i should stay here
with jack jack
that's my girl
remember  bob
we're both turning right
you know what's sad
if it weren't
for your core beliefs
i think we could have
been good friends
at least
i have core beliefs
i we have breaking news     i
i while there is
still no radio contact   i
i the ship
has changed direction     i
i and is heading towards land  i
i at a high rate of speed   i
so  dash
i am going to the rudder
once i turn the ship
you hit the pull up button
  okay  dad
  now lower me down
the reputations of
superheroes are ruined
you will never
become legal  ever
never
no
  ever
  no
not even a little
smidgee widgee
oh  hypoxia
when you don't have
enough oxygen
things seem really silly
things get sillier
and sillier
and then you die
i don't wanna die
ah  nobody does
really
not such
a bad way to go
everyone  we need to get
to the back of the ship
all supers
protect your ambassadors
follow
dad's been underwater
for too long
we gotta pull him up
wait  it's too soon
i'm gonna press the button
not yet
it's turning  it's working
  now
  dash  now
save yourself  make a chute
make a chute  make a chute
make a chute
helen
brace yourselves
crash positions
whoo
i missed
jack jack's first power
actually  you missed
the first 17
oh
the fact that you saved me
doesn't make you right
but it does make you alive
and i'm grateful
for that
i'm sorry
but she'll go to prison
well  i'm sorry she's rich
and will probably get no more
than a slap on the wrist
first of all  violet
i like you
and who knows what the
future may bring
but i have a good feeling
about all of you
hmm  good feeling
should we be worried
you guys got the next shift
i'm beat  oh
i saw what you did back there
that was incredible
no pun intended
sorry i had
to punch you
yeah  baby  my sweet ride
and in recognition
of the extraordinary service
they have demonstrated
the legal status
of superheroes
is hereby restored
you don't know me
do you
no  i don't
wait
are you the girl
with the water
i'm violet parr
  i'm tony
  okay
you split up into separate
groups and stuff
tony  this is my mom
pleased to meet you
  this is my dad
  oh  we've met
and this is embarrassing
charmed  i'm sure
my little brother  dash
and the baby
is jack jack
i tried to limit it
to one parent
we're all going to a movie
too  tony  don't mind us
we'll be sitting
on the other side
of the theater
not watching you
he's kidding
they are only dropping
us off at the theater
they have
other things to do
so  you guys are close
i guess
  yeah  i guess
  we can get closer
