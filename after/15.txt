hey  you guys want to see something funny
oh  if this is where you lift your shirt up
and make your belly button sing    no  thank you
even better  check out this video i made of charlie
being a baby stinks
food's too mushy  gross and too juicy
and the tv shows they make me watch are insulting
ahh  much better
life is good
p j   you are gonna have to put that online so grandma can see it
grandma knows how to go online
p j   you're gonna have to put that on a dvd
so grandma can watch it
grandma got a dvd  player
okay  p j   you're just gonna have to go over to grandma's house
and act it out for her
okay  where is the library
donde esta la libraria
okay  you're really cute when you roll your rs
but it's "biblioteca "
biblioteca
but say "libraria" again
libraria
your rrrs make me all mmm
hey  listen  i want to ask you something
ooh  that sounds interesting  what is it
well
gabe  do you mind
no  you can stay
let's go upstairs
good idea  i was gonna say something
but i didn't want to be rude
okay  now what did you want to ask me
i was wondering if
it was embarrassing
it was a simple question
your father shouts at me from two aisles away
"hey  ames  what kind of toilet paper you like
quilted or super quilted "
hey  look  spencer's here
so what  the world doesn't know
that the great amy duncan uses toilet paper
nice to see you  mr  and mrs  duncan
after all that shouting  you got the wrong kind
well  that's because i'm not bob the toilet paper psychic
right this way
well  on the bright side
you got the wrong trash bags too
sorry about my parents
wow  i say that a lot
so what i wanted to ask you was
i'm gonna get you  i'm gonna get you
yes  i am  yes  i am
yes  i am
okay  let's go outside
it usually takes him a while to get her
okay  i think i'm all out of family members
but you'd better talk fast
okay  i was wondering
if you would wear my football jersey on friday
it's sort of a tradition that the players' girlfriends
wear their jerseys on game day
so that would make me
your girlfriend
yeah
cool
because i wasn't exactly sure of our status
and i was too nervous to ask
and i didn't want to be one of those girls
that made you talk about it  but then again
so that's a yes on the jersey
of course it's a yes  boyfriend
back to the store
where the correct answer was super quilted
whoa  this is amazing  that charlie video has gone viral
what does that mean
that it's gotten a million hits since last tuesday
and now i'll answer your next question
that means over a million people have seen it
so what  you put that on the facetube
yeah  that's right  dad    the facetube

dad  stop  you're making us sound like we're rich
we don't have our own mountain
we share it with another family
speaking of families  teddy  when are we gonna get to meet yours
uh  they're kind of busy
so maybe next summer
or the one after that
okay  everyone  i have the news on in the kitchen
you have got to see these people
and when they saw what great work i was doing out in the field
they said  "hey  we need her on 'good morning campus today '"
rick  you might say
it was an offer i couldn't refuse
if we could get back to charlie
why don't we talk to the proud papa
whew
whoa  look  dad  you're sweating right through your shirt
uh
you know  rick
something i find very interesting
is that cell phones have gotten so much smaller
back to you  rick
so  pj  you're the director of this little epic
that's right  rick    director  writer  editor and voice
i don't know what a producer does
but i probably did that too
what are you doing
well  you just give it to me and i'll throw it back to you
no  we're done
at least let me throw it back to yolanda in the studio
no  i do that  back to yolanda in the studio
what is wrong with you people
i thought you'd enjoy that
you have no idea
what a family  the woman
she looks like a circus clown
clowns are fun
what about the big sweaty oaf  he was a piece of work
oafs are fun
where did they find these people
mom  dad  stop  okay  that's teddy's family
that's a good one  spence
no  he's not kidding
oh  but teddy  you're nothing like those people
you're so poised and sophisticated and
excuse me
i said
i can do that because i'm a duncan
i'm the product of the sweaty oaf and the crazy clown
oh teddy  i'm sorry  we didn't know
oh  no no  it's okay  yesterday i was embarrassed by them too
and i even told them that  and then i came over here
so i could pretend that i was one of you
but i'm not  i'm one of them
i sweat  i fart and i burp
you're not gonna do that again  are you
no
in fact  i should probably get back to my family
in this  their darkest hour
paul
