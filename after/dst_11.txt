okay
jo i'm here because i'm not happy
and do you know why i'm not happy

okay maybe a little
oh so i had a chat with your little friend jo
did she punch you
no
kick you
no
okay well get this turns out she has a crush on you
she does  why does she keep hitting me
well she has trouble expressing her feelings
and then she gets frustrated and lashes out
so i get punched for being a hunk

she really said she likes me
whoa wait do you like her too
eww that's just disgusting
okay maybe a little
hi mr  duncan
hi madison
p j 's downstairs
thanks
bobby
kitty kat
look at you
look at you
look at me
hey honey  i'd like you to meet kitty    katherine
i'm madison's mom
hi i'm amy  p j 's mom
and bob's first wife
can you believe our kids are dating each other
that's a crazy twist isn't it
whoo
well i've got to run  it was so nice to meet you
and so great to see you again bobby
yeah  okay
kitty kat huh
well i could come up with a nickname for you
like
you know it's really funny
'cause i'm thinking of a lot of nicknames for you
hi boyfriend
hi girlfriend
hi emmett
girlfriend
you guys are rehearsing  should i come back later
  no    yes
no we're just finishing up
aren't we
we started five minutes ago
it was a good five minutes
i feel like i'm intruding
  no you're not     yes you are
i'll be upstairs
okay one two one two three four
no emmett stop
what
i don't like the way you were talking to my girlfriend
i don't like the way she's interrupting our rehearsal
she has no respect for the process
we don't have a process
she doesn't know that
everyone knows that
what's more important to you
your girlfriend or this band
this band was just a way to get girls
which i did
fine
then this band is through
i'll take my drums and get out of your life
someone will be by to collect my things
hey what are you doing out here
just thinking
p j  and the vibe broke up today
oh well son it's hard to keep a band together
and you guys did have some challenges
most of them musical
we'd still be together
if emmett wasn't jealous of my girlfriend
son you've been spending an awful lot of time with madison
now did you ever consider that maybe emmett feels rejected
by my girlfriend
by you
because i have a girlfriend
because you've been ignoring him
because of my girlfriend
p j  i'm ready to break up with you
son you can't let a girl
come between you and your best friend
but madison's softer and smells better than emmett
look trust me on this okay
i nearly made the same mistake
when i was dating madison's mom
really  what happened
katherine was too clingy
too demanding
she came between me and my friends
so i did what i had to do
let her go
said goodbye
no more bobby love for her
bobby love  that's what she called you
oh you know it
um that one we don't need to share with your mom
this is weird  i don't usually get invited
to play dates with the kids i beat up
about that    i talked to gabe
and turns out he kinds of likes you too
he does
why are you clenching your fist
i feel like punching someone
okay well we need to work on
how you express yourself with boys
why don't we try a little role playing okay
i'll be gabe you'll be you
okay
so let's pretend we run into each other at school
  hi jo     hi gabe
i like your jacket
well somebody knows karate
sorry  it was a reflex
let me try again
okay but this time
let's keep our hands to ourselves okay
got it
okay  hi jo
hi gabe
want to sit with me at lunch
yah
i see you found a loophole
you didn't say anything about the feet
and now you've learned the word "loophole "
now try this time
with no hands and no feet
or anything else you could hit me with
got it
hi jo  you look nice
very good jo
you clenched your fist and then you unclenched
that is called progress
feels weird without hitting
but i kind of like it
what is she doing here
no no it's okay  you have nothing to worry about
right jo
right
hey gabe  you look nice
what
she gave you a compliment  say something nice back
uh
your hair looks softer than your fists
thanks
why don't you two hang out for a while
i'll be upstairs trying to decide
if i should apply ice or heat
so what do you like to do
i like monster trucks
mixed martial arts and dolls
you like video games
what do you got
"galaxy of death "
is it violent
level two comes with the barf bags
it's really fun
you had me at barf bag
hey what are you doing here
i'm between deliveries
but i really wanted to say something to you
first i'm like totally psyched that you're my girlfriend
great  anything else
well yeah  i was just thinking
that we should be spending a little less time together
you know so we still have time for friends
works for me
not starting right now  madison what's going on
nothing
gotta get to work babe
who's that
nobody
see you later babe
nice hat
thanks
you too
who was that
just the pizza delivery guy
really  don't they usually deliver pizzas
to your house not from your house
i don't
and don't they usually not kiss the customers
and call them "babe"
you were cheating on me with pizza pirate
no actually i was cheating on pizza pirate
with kwikki chikki
that's it  we're through
are you breaking up with me
unless you promise never to see him again
yeah we should probably break up
he gave me a whole bunch of coupons
get off me  help  ow
jo what are you doing
this is not the way to express yourself
this is not about me liking gabe
this is about him cheating at "galaxy of death "
i didn't cheat
get this whacko off me
come on jo get off him
let go  let go
whoa
you want some of this
hey charlie
well today was a bad day for the duncan kids
we learned that sometimes love hurts
no kidding  jo dislocated my shoulder
madison dislocated my heart
well maybe love gets easier as we get older
honey it's no kitty kat but at least it's a nickname
amy potomus
well when you say it like that
or maybe love never gets easier
then again you might be the one to figure that out
good luck with that charlie
hi
heard about your breakup
who told you
i saw you change your online status
from "in a relationship" to "dumped "
bring it here
it hurts so much
i know  emmett's here
let it out
and ignore my last voicemail
  what    no no no no
hey gabe  nice backpack
what do you want jo
i think i was pretty clear  i want your backpack
no
i'm sorry did you just say no
you heard me
you're not bullying me anymore
what you're gonna sic your sister on me again
i'm not afraid of her
i have more than one sister
and that's after only one karate lesson
