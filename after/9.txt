hey  charlie  it's your big sister teddy
with the latest installment of my video diary
teddy  turn that thing off  it's breakfast time
in a minute
that noise you hear is our neighbor's annoying new dog
ever since she got that little rat
none of us have gotten any sleep
teddy  i asked you to do something
and i asked for a minute
your breakfast is getting cold
well  then just put it back in the toaster
sorry you had to see that
there is no prize in here  there's supposed to be a prize
you took it out yesterday
i know  but i put it back in
so i'd have something to look forward to
bob  where are you
can i have a minute
well  hurry up
you're missing quality family time
gabe  stop hitting the toaster
but it's taking forever
i don't even remember what i put in here
okay  charlie  i will get you your juice in just a minute  honey
whoa  even charlie's in a mood
morning
bob  did you forget to do something
i'll kiss you tonight
no  you only shaved half your face
pick  pick  pick
maybe this is how i like to wear it now
well  it looks ridiculous
what if i decided just to brush half my hair
i thought you already made that decision
oh  you are going down
wait  stop  stop  do you guys hear that
i don't hear anything
exactly
the barking stopped
  oh  come on     really
today's all burnt toast
running late  and dad jokes
has anybody seen my left shoe
i close my eyes  take a bite
grab a ride  laugh out loud
there it is up on the roof
i've been there  i've survived
so just take my advice
hang in there  baby
things are crazy
but i know your future is bright
hang in there  baby
there is no maybe
eveything turns out all right
sure life is up and down
but trust me  it comes back all around
you're gonna love who you turn out to be
hang in there  baby
good luck charlie  s01e09  up a tree
well  at least charlie's getting some sleep
why did mrs  dabney have to get that stupid dog  anyway
why couldn't she get something that made less noise
like a fish
fish don't make any noise
i wish you were a fish
can we all agree that thing is a pest
because as an exterminator  it is my job
to take care of pests
when you say "take care of "
i know you actually mean kill
which i'm totally fine with  by the way
i'll just go over to mrs  dabney's and demand
she keep the dog in at night
or we could just try being friendly
friendly  with mrs  dabney
what is this  crazy idea day
okay  look  i am serious
how about i invite her over tonight
for a cup of coffee and i bake a pie
i thought you wanted this to go well
okay  we'll have mrs  dabney over
but i want everybody on their best behavior
especially you  mister
i don't think i have a best behavior
yeah  well  you'd better find one before tonight
in her defense  mrs  dabney wasn't always like this
she actually used to be kind of nice
when was that
let's see  how old are you
all right  got my pie
what do you want
we don't want anything  mrs  dabney
yeah  we're just being neighborly
what did he do
i didn't do anything
i don't like you  gabe
but i like you  mrs  dabney
in fact  i'd like to take care of you
out
mrs  dabney  so you have a new dog
a little chihuahua
so that's what this is about
it's not not what this is about
dog's got a name    hercules
that's funny because
hercules is like so big and strong
and your dog is so
just being neighborly
look  the thing is  hercules has a tendency to bark
a lot
all night long
right  so we were wondering if maybe
you could bring him in before bedtime
oh  no  fresh air's good for dogs
well  sleep is good for people
i had that same thought
after every one of your many babies arrived
we were talking about the dog
well  since we're airing our grievances
we begged her not to make that pie
i was gonna say that maybe there's a little something
you can do for me
oh  mrs  dabney  we've already told you
we're not sending gabe to military school
but if it's a deal breaker  we are willing to send him
to other places
i was talking about your oak tree out back
there's a branch that hangs over my yard
always dropping acorns and making a big mess
well  no problem
dog goes in  branch comes off
we got a deal
we have a deal
dad  that branch holds our treehouse
well  so what  you kids haven't been up there in years
i'm confused  is gabe going somewhere or not
you know  if that treehouse comes down
that'll be even better    more sunlight for my vegetable garden
start eating healthier    might even make my goal
of living to be 100
mrs  dabney  don't you want to stay and finish your pie
you have a good night  now
she's gone  but i didn't get my hug
well  at least we'll finally be able to get some sleep
too bad we have to lose our treehouse
we have a treehouse
yeah
teddy and i used to go up there all the time when we were little
yeah  we had so much fun up there
are you kidding me
all you two ever did up there was fight
that's not how i remember it  we had great times
yeah  i mean  except for  you know  all those times
that you fell out the window
oh  i enjoyed those too
how did i not know we had a treehouse
well  'cause it's kind of overgrown
i built it that summer we went to hawaii
you guys went to hawaii
yeah  we used to do all kinds of fun stuff
when did that stop
well  how old are you
check it out  charlie
here's our old treehouse
oh  look  here's your old tea party set
and all our board games
oh  wait    and look at this
these are the chinese handcuffs
that pj always used to get stuck in
uh    a little help
oh  baby booboo
oh my goodness  i thought i lost her
it's been so many years
and those years have not been kind
yeah  i remember  i used to come up here
and pretend booboo was a real baby
i was a very good mother  huh
until you left your baby in a treehouse for 10 years
oh  whoa  look
here's something you carved into the wall
"p j  hearts p b " who's p b
peanut butter
it was a simpler time
you know what stinks
when they premix it with the jelly
no  it stinks that charlie's never gonna
get to use this treehouse
she'd probably love it up here
hey  kids  come on down now
p j   we have to save this place for charlie
well  i wish we could  but dad made a deal
yeah well  deals are made to be broken
right
the golden rule
  hey  kids     hey  dad
we changed our minds  we don't want to lose the treehouse after all
it's too late  i already shook hands on it
well  can we at least talk about this
yeah  maybe take a family vote
this isn't a democracy  guys
and by the way  even if it was
the guy with the chainsaw
always wins
come on  come on down
no
no
no  we're not leaving
yeah  we're staying right here
we're fighting the power
get down here now or you're grounded
you can't ground someone who's not actually on the ground
yeah  right on  p j  fight the power
you know what
good luck fighting the power saw
you're coming down one way or another
no  we are not  okay  we have history on our side
we are going to protest peacefully
like gandhi and martin luther king
he had a dream
yeah well  i got a dream too  teddy
to get some sleep
you're not scaring us
no  we laugh at you
all right  you know what
i'm done messing around  i'm bringing out the big guns
that's right    mom
you go get mom
yeah  she doesn't scare us
this is bad  he's getting mom
lock her up
go out there and get your kids out of that tree
okay  why are they always my kids
when they won't do what you want
they're having some kind of sit in
to try and save the treehouse
now  i appreciate that they're taking a stand
i just don't like that it's against me
would you calm down
but i'm the father
i'm in charge around here
when you're not home
honey  you are getting upset over nothing
this is teddy and p j  we're talking about
they can't be in the same room for five minutes
without getting into a fight
they won't last an hour up there
all right
but when they come down  they're getting punished for defying me
if that's okay with you
i'm tired
i'm cold
how much longer can we keep this up
we've been up here for 12 minutes
if i had known we were gonna protest
i would have prepared
for one thing  i wouldn't have had
that extra large root beer
all right  let's just stay focused on why we're here
for charlie
that doesn't help
charlie gets to pee whenever she wants
  which is why my idea      okay  please don't tell me
about diaper for teens again
hey  gabe
hey
so  this is the famous treehouse i never knew about
want to join our sit in
it's just like when gandhi and billie jean king
teamed up to stop the civil war
almost every word in that sentence was wrong
what do you say  gabe  are you in
i'm in
  great     yeah
but first  you'll need to bring us some supplies
just the essentials
snacks  my video games  my guitar
whoa  dude  this is a sit in
not a move in
oh  and some peanut butter
yeah  that's right  the love affair continues
well  i'll be back
what are you doing
i'm gonna join the sit in
i have to do what's right
how about i take you out for ice cream instead
i'll be in the car
what was that crazy card game
we used to play with all the eights
crazy eights
no
where is gabe with the snacks
now i'm getting hungry
so hungry
i keep thinking i smell steak cooking
yeah  me too
really
oh  hey
don't mind me    just making dinner for my family
you know  the ones on the ground
yeah  okay  we know what you're doing
and it's not gonna work
well  suit yourself
but i'm making one medium rare
the way i know someone likes
i like medium rare  he's talking about me
stay strong
now  i'm gonna be right back
i'm going inside the house
to check on my chocolate souffle
two can play at this game
yeah  if we had a barbecue and some steaks
catch of the day    t bone
yes
  okay     no  no  no
you'll never get the t bone  go for the filet
i think i got it  i got it  i got it
i have never loved you more than
idiot
i think somebody overcooked their fishing pole
this looks more medium well
i'm so hungry
and there's nothing to eat up here
or is there  acorns    acorns are food  right
for squirrels
how do squirrels do this
well  they're squirrels
you know what
i can't take this anymore  i'm done
wait  no
you're just giving up  that is so like you
what is so like me
to be a quitter
yeah  well  you're bossy
i am not bossy
and don't you ever call me that again  i forbid you
  bossy     quitty
oh  real mature
i am more mature than you are
whatever  oh  okay
okay
all right  drop the bat
or baby booboo becomes baby barbecue
you wouldn't dare
try me
give me the baby
give me the bat
the baby
the bat
p j
pull me up  pull me up
oh  wait  are you quitting
what
you know  like
if i pull you back in  will you keep doing the sit in
since my alternative is a face first dive
into a hot barbecue    yes
one more thing
you have to drive me wherever i want to go
for the next month
deal
now pull me up my face is browning
okay
thank you for saving me
no problem
although  you wouldn't have had to save me
if you didn't push me out of a treehouse
whoa whoa whoa  hey hey  stop
whoa  truce  truce
gosh  what is wrong with us  we're going at it like seven year olds
mom was right
we did fight up here all the time  didn't we
yes  and nothing's changed  we're still doing it
is this the way it's always gonna be between us
i hope not
i don't want to be sitting on the porch
of our old folks' home whacking each other
with foam bats
oh  do we have to live in the same old folks' home
p j   if we can't come together
and do this one thing for charlie
we're never gonna come together on anything
you're right
we can do this    for charlie
for charlie
so
what do you want to do now
i don't know
i wish we could hurry up and save this treehouse
so we could get the heck out of this treehouse
they're still up in that tree
you said they'd be down by now
well  i thought they would be
why is there a plastic hook in my steak
eat around it
you know  when you think about it
this is actually kind of nice  i mean  teddy and p j
are finally working together on something  i'm proud of them
whose side are you on
ours or the rebels
the rebels
okay  you realize
we're not actually at war  right
of course i do
for that to happen  someone would have to issue
a formal declaration of war
which should almost be done printing out
bob  they're doing exactly what we taught them to do
they're standing up for what they believe in
well  you know what  now we're going to teach them
don't mess with daddy
gabe  go get your water balloon launcher
okay
gabe  sit
bob  you're taking this too far
no i'm not  and i gave you an order  mister
gabe  stand down
sorry  dad  but i'm a little more afraid of mom
fine  i'll fight this battle myself
hey  sweetheart  you're not really afraid of me  are you
a little
good
i'm giving you one last chance to come down
okay  all right
i don't like doing this  but you've forced my hand
oh  come on  so lucky
you got so lucky  you know what
next one's coming right through the window
oh  yeah  take that
what are you doing
fightin' the power
but we're the power
the kids are right  this treehouse is worth saving
what is going on over here
you know  this really isn't a good time  mrs  dabney
you'd better get a handle on that family of yours
'cause right now  it looks like they're kicking your butt
would you let me deal with this  please
you'd better  'cause hercules is getting kinda lonely
i'm thinking of getting another dog
are you threatening me
this one's gonna be female
might even have some puppies
that's right
you go get them down
time to put on the big pants
he's coming up
we have to stop him
hold your fire
careful
this could be a trick
i come in peace  i've come to join the resistance
all right  yeah
that's right  mrs  dabney
i don't care about your dog
oh  the big pants are on
and they're staying up here with my family
we did it  yes
you can have a treehouse  charlie
for a long long time
what was that
wait  have we ever all been up here at the same time
is everyone okay
  yeah      i think so
whoa  look
oh  hon
was that so hard
yeah
well  the treehouse is down
so  you're gonna be bringing your dog in tonight  right
oh  hercules doesn't belong to me
i was just dogsitting for a couple of days
i'm a cat person
and an excellent negotiator
do not throw that balloon
we're gonna launch that balloon  mister
dad
well  charlie  dad and the boys
are building you a new treehouse
so someday you can go up there and play with baby booboo
you know  just as soon as we find her head
right now  she's baby tennis ball  yeah
no  not as much fun
oh  and i want to recommend that you make the treehouse
no boys allowed
especially if that boy weighs as much as dad
because if you do let him up there
well  good luck  charlie
what are you doing
gabe says he's more scared of mom than he is of me
so i'm going to scare him
hey  dad
gabe  honey  did you finish your homework
ah    mummy mom
you'd got it all you don't
