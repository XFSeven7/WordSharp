uh oh  charlie  look at your tummy
i think somebody's had enough pancakes  no no
oh my goodness
somebody loves her blankie
whoo
all right  dad  now pull out your blankie
sure thing  son
right after i drop you off at a military school
oh  hey  look what's gonna happen on saturday
oh  yeah  the truck from the thrift store is coming
and it's your wedding anniversary
right
what time is the truck coming
so how are you guys gonna celebrate this year
there's no better way to celebrate than the tax deduction
we're gonna get from donating old clothes
bob  remember the deduction from our 10th anniversary
ooh
guys  guys  guys  you know what
i think we should do something for mom and dad on their anniversary
don't we do enough for them on mother's and father's day
you never do anything for them
excuse me  i was born  which made them a mother and a father
my work is done
well  i think  we should surprise them with a romantic dinner
you're gonna make a dinner
i think we should surprise them
and order a romantic dinner
then we can serve it to them like waiters
why do girl ideas always take so much work
i get it
if we do something nice for them
they have to do something nice for us
like give us presents   yes
why can't we just do it because we love them
because then we don't get stuff  duh
today's all burnt toast
running late  and dad jokes
has anybody seen my left shoe
i close my eyes  take a bite
grab a ride  laugh out loud
there it is up on the roof
i've been there  i've survived
so just take my advice
hang in there  baby
things are crazy
but i know your future is bright
hang in there  baby
there is no maybe
eveything turns out all right
sure life is up and down
but trust me  it comes back all around
you're gonna love who you turn out to be
hang in there  baby
good luck charlie  s01e14  blankie go bye bye
hey
shouldn't someone go tell charlie to shut up
you know what  you give it a shot
we've been trying all night long
and by "we" he means me
come on  i got up that one time
and when you flushed  you woke her up
but why is she so fussy
we can't find her blankie  and we've looked everywhere
oh  that's ridiculous
she shouldn't need something to help her sleep
what about your stuffed monkey
coco's different
guys  what a horrible way to spend your anniversary
we should really get out of the house
ow  what are you doing
oh
mom and dad  on your anniversary
i'm taking you to lunch and a movie
my treat
oh  dad  bring your wallet
you don't know what "my treat" means  do you
okay  we'd love to go to a movie  kids
but not when charlie's so upset
i'll find charlie's blankie and take care of her
now you two go out and enjoy some alone time
on your anniversary
with gabe
and i know the perfect movie to see
"star exploders ii  ticking asteroids" in 3d
hey  you know what  the critics hated that
that means it's gotta be good
oh  yeah
or we could see "the willow weeps tomorrow "
what's that about
it's a haunting tale of a young girl
who lives on a farm  plants a willow tree
and grows up with dreams of becoming a ballerina
and then on the day of the big audition
she twists her ankle  goes back to the farm
gets married and has a baby
and do you know what she names it
willow
i feel like we just saw it
and hated it
oh  come on  guys  it's my anniversary too
no no no  you're absolutely right
look  we don't have to figure this out now
we'll decide when we get to the theater
okay
okay
"star exploders"
charlie  i'm looking for your blankie  please stop crying
oh  look  it's your favorite show
"the circles  " they're the colorful singing shapes
that teach you about shapes
i am a red circle  yes  i am
i am big and round and red
hey
man  this is annoying
oh  what's this i found  is this your blankie
i'll take that as a no
let's take you on a walk
that'll make you feel better
yay
excuse me
excuse me
great  i think i'm the only woman in here
hey  what about
nope
i'm kind of getting hungry
yeah  you know what  let's eat
pass this to your dad
isn't this great
not having to buy that movie theater food
we're saving so much money
i guess i had a different picture in my mind
when gabe said "lunch and a movie "
i think he said "lunch in a movie "
mom  do you have my milkshake
oh
you know what  i think it's easier
if you just stick the straw in
hey  the movie's starting
really
excuse me  could you take off your tentacles
got the cake
whoa  what's all this about
oh  it's the theme for tonight's dinner
i turned the living room into a moroccan palace
so we'll be serving moroccan food
won't that make dad gassy
name a country that won't make dad gassy
good point
are you still looking for charlie's blankie
i can't find it anywhere
i thought i put it in that pile of dirty clothes
we have a dirty clothes pile
yeah  it's where your clothes magically go
after you throw them on the floor
i hope you didn't put it on the donation pile
for the thrift store  'cause that is long gone
we gave her blankie away
you gave her blankie away
we have to get it back
you have to get it back
stop saying that
you stop saying that
you know  i'm usually the one who messes things up
but this time everything on my side of the operation
is going just fine  see
"bon voyage  esther   marty"
oops
you brought home the wrong cake
can't we just tell mom and dad
that "bon voyage" is french for "happy anniversary"
what about "esther   marty"
who cares about them  they're on a ship
okay  we still have time before mom and dad get home
we can fix this
how
you drop me off at the thrift store
i'll grab the blankie while you go switch cakes
let's do it
let's do it with charlie
oh
yeah
that was awesome
and derivative
they did it in "solar troopers  star quest iv "
how many stars have to explode before this thing is over
10  365
or so they said in the chat room
hey  mom  could you jiggle your purse
my shake's clogging
honey  put your phone away  it's distracting
my phone is distracting from the 3d destruction of the milky way
do you mind
you were talking too
about the movie  which is totally allowed
oh  yeah
honey  honey  where are you going
out
excuse me  could you move your flipper
i should go talk to her
mr  president
only you can give the order to explode the supernova
may the galaxy forgive me
whoo
excuse me  excuse me
hi  i donated something and i have to get it back
oh  dear
someone doesn't know what the word "donation" means
see  darling  when you "donate" something  you "do not" get it back
you don't understand how important this is
i accidentally gave away my baby sister's blankie
your baby sister's blankie
i still don't care
did someone wake up on the wrong side of the bed
i sleep on the futon  mama gets the bed
can you help me
i'm afraid it's out of my hands
everything that was donated this week is already on that truck
leslie's dog washing service
if your pooch is dirty  i'll make him purty
side business  i'm also a life coach

i went to the thrift store and you weren't there
i'm locked in the back of a truck
ooh  this is cute
someone threw this out
what  teddy  i can't hear you
try going outside to get better reception
if i could go outside  i wouldn't have to call you
okay  i have an idea    why don't i go outside
can i hear you now
i'm locked in the back of a truck
locked in the back of a truck
teddy  how could you be so stupid

ugh
you can do that  but you can't open the door
hey  honey  you're missing the whole movie
yeah  that's kind of the idea
what are you doing out here
the guy with the tentacles cut the cheese
yeah  it was the guy with the tentacles
honey  what's wrong
i don't know
i guess the truth is it would be nice to do more on our anniversary
we used to do special things
now we're eating onion rings out of my purse
there were onion rings
but i thought we agreed
we weren't gonna do anything special
yeah  i know  i know we did
so now you want to do special things
well  it's better than doing unspecial things
like sitting in a theater full of 40 year old nerds
hey  i'm only 36
okay  you know what
you guys go back and enjoy your movie
and i'm gonna go see "the willow weeps tomorrow "
no  honey  wait a minute  wait a minute  wait a minute
are you gonna want the onion rings or
here you go
happy anniversary
i don't think i handled that very well
ya think
oh  man
i should have planned something
well  maybe you did
what do you mean
well  teddy  p  j  and i are surprising you guys
with an anniversary dinner
it was all my idea  not teddy's
but i can let you take the credit
are you serious  you'd do that for me
sure  just remember me on gabe's day
what's gabe's day
surprise me
agh  an arm
my goodness  people will donate anything
a little help here
what are you doing in the back of my truck
looking for my sister's blankie  and it's not in here
although i did find this really cute top  see
you know what would look good with that
get out of my truck
but i don't even know where i am
you're in the driveway of my house
mama always likes first dibs on my pile
wait  and you still have to sleep on the futon
that just doesn't seem right
would you mind telling that to my mama
charlie  please open the door
open window
ha ha  coming  charlie
this is so sad
i know
first she loses her man
and now her sense of smell
her problem is she loves too much
i smell oscar
but she won't
what are you doing here
i was worried about you
and our movie ended
ow
look  honey  i wasn't gonna tell you this
but i've got an anniversary surprise waiting for you at home
really  what is it
if i told you  it wouldn't be much of a surprise now  would it
oh
i love you
thanks for staying and watching the rest of the movie with me
oh
okay
why do i have to stay
because if you don't  gabe's day is canceled
what are you doing here
i have a heart as well as a brain
i'm not a robot
i wish i was
hey  dad  do you want to switch seats
so then i left broadway
i've never looked back
i can't believe i didn't find charlie's blankie
i could have sworn
i looked at every single thing in that truck
were you even listening to my life's story
does the name patti lupone mean nothing to you
i'm sorry  i just
what are you sitting on
just a little blanket
no  that's charlie's blankie  give me that
oh  there
why were you sitting on it
how shall i put this
i have a medical condition known as posterial hydrosis
what's that
butt sweats
eww
well  at least i got it back
stop the truck  back it up
boop boop boop
okay  look  before we go in i just want to say something
now i know i'm not always the most romantic guy
but i should be  because you deserve it
happy anniversary
surprise
oh  charlie
what happened
ask dad  he planned the whole thing
for your anniversary we'd like to serve you
a traditional moroccan feast
but since that ended up on the floor
we bring you
peanut butter toast
this is so sweet of you kids
you know  i think this turned out to be
a pretty great anniversary after all
i don't even mind that i'm sitting in couscous
and now it's time for the entertainment
ladies and gentlemen  may i present to you
the dancing duncans
isn't it amazing how a little piece of cloth
can make someone so happy
even when it's covered in tire tracks and butt sweat
i'm gonna wash it after you fall asleep
but it's so funny  because we love our blankies so much
and then one day we forget all about them
and if you're like me
you'll grow out of yours by the time you're five
good night
but if you're like gabe
you might bring it on your honeymoon
good luck  charlie
hey  you know what  i'm kind of hungry
pass this your dad
anything else
i had chicken yesterday  got anything else
what  no fixings
hold on
hey  honey  aren't you gonna have something
oh  i almost forgot
okay
who ordered nachos
that would be me
shh
