mr  gerkin  the fast food industry is booming
and offers a bright future
this is great
this is terrible
i got a "b"
so did i
i can't believe i got a real "b"
as opposed to what
a "d" that i have to write another "d" on top of
to make it look like a "b"
mr  dingwall
can i ask you a quick question
you just did  goodbye
no  actually it's about my grade
i was kind of expecting an "a"
"a"
the same letter that begins the words "annoying"
and "adios "
can you just explain to me why i got a "b"
english is my best subject
although my math and science teachers would argue with that
here's another one   aloha
today's all burnt toast
running late  and dad jokes

i close my eyes  take a bite
grab a ride  laugh out loud

i've been there  i've survived
so just take my advice
hang in there  baby
things are crazy
but i know your future is bright
hang in there  baby

hey  ready for your basketball game
do i have to go
all we ever do is lose
that is not true
sometimes you forfeit
oh  honey  it's important to think positive
true  you've lost 11 games in a row
and you're dead last in the league  but  
i don't know where i'm going with this
bad news  gabe
i can't coach your game today
just got an emergency extermination call
what's the big emergency
ladybug infestation
aww
oh  sure  one's cute
thousands   unspeakable horror
so i guess without a coach
we won't be able to play our game today
hey  wait a minute  i can coach
that's cute  honey
but coaching's a little more complicated than you might think
oh  honey  i can lose just as good as you can
what am i saying  i can't coach
i have mommy   me with charlie
i could take charlie to mommy   me
honey  that's cute  but mommy   me
is a little more complicated than you might think
actually  it's really not  you go ahead and take her
all right  honey  looks like you're in
here's the playbook
now this might be a little over your head
so just do your best
xs are our team  os are the other guys
okay  the xs have lost 11 games in a row  right
right
we're gonna be the os this week
hi  charlie  it's your big sister teddy here
or should i say big failure teddy
i just wanted to show you how sad i look after i got my first "b"
and i just want to show you how happy i look when i got my first "b"
whoo
sorry you had to see that
i do not deserve a "b"
i felt the same way
you know  i know why dingwall gave me a bad grade
he just doesn't like me
you know  that could be
whenever he talks to you  he makes a face like somebody just cut one
but it's not fair
i never cut one  it's always gerkin
so what if dingwall doesn't like you  who cares
i care  no one's ever not liked me before
i don't mean to be conceited  but likable people like me are liked
it's just a fact
as long as you're not conceited
i know what i gotta do  get dingwall to like me
i know what i gotta do   more dancing
i still got some happy left in me
you'd better watch out if i ever get an "a"
hey  dad
hey  how was mommy   me
it was awesome  the moms loved me
i told them some jokes  made them laugh
taught them how to change their ringtones
did charlie have a good time
i don't know  i wasn't really watching her
so  how bad was it
it was terrible
it was terrible for the other team
because we won  we won  ooh ooh
i don't believe it  where's gabe
he went out for ice cream with the rest of the team
right after they carried me to my car
chanting "amy  amy "
really  such a fuss
did the other team just not show up
oh  they showed up
but they wish they hadn't  kapow
that's amazing
actually  it wasn't as hard as you thought
i just told the boys to go out there and have fun
did you at least use the playbook
absolutely
the bench was freezing  so i sat on it
hello  hey  angie
look  i'm sorry i couldn't make it to mommy   me  
you want to talk to p j
i think he's here  hang on a sec
p j
yeah
hello  oh  hey  ange
yeah  it was fun hanging out with you too
that's hilarious
oh no  you didn't
you guys mind  this is kinda personal
by the way  did you see linda's hair
right
hey  there's my winner
hey  dad
congratulations
i mean  obviously a fluke  right
happening when your mom was coaching
but you know what  i think we can build on this
yeah yeah  dad  we need to talk
what about
have a seat
okay
what's up
these things are never easy
what things
look  the team talked things over
and we think it's in everyone's best interest
if we make some changes involving the coaching staff
the coaching staff  i'm the coaching staff
yeah
oh  wait a minute
are you firing me
after everything i've done for this team
we wish you the best
oh  come on
oh  come on
hey  give me another chance
i can turn this thing around
i think we're done here
oh  dad
would you send mom in  i have some good news for her
hey  mr  "d"
got a little present for you  
some yummy homemade brownies  just 'cause
school district policy prohibits me from receiving gifts
which  judging by these  does not appear to be a tragedy
well  i thought you might have a sweet tooth like me  
just one more thing we have in common
i mean  besides our ethnic heritage
this should be good
dingwall is a scottish name  like duncan
i looked up your family crest
did you know that it's two eagles in flight
miss duncan  let's cut to the chase
you're here about your grade  right
you are one sharp scottish cookie
the issue is your oral book reports
i work very hard on those
they're lifeless and dry
and that's coming from me
okay  so i'll jazz them up
find a way to make the book come alive
put your energy into that instead of kissing up to your teacher
which i find shallow  insulting and  
adorable
what
honey  come on  let's go
who   who   who is that
who is that
that's my mom and my sister charlie
aren't you the cutest baby ever
we like to think so
and you look just like your mommy
if you're saying i'm the cutest mommy ever
i accept
teddy dear  i had no idea you had a baby sister
teddy  dear
who is that  who is that
who is that
what are you doing
i'm watching my book
for your book report
that's right
aren't you supposed to  oh  i don't know  read your book
teddy  get with it
kids don't read anymore  you're so old school
and if you don't read your book  you're gonna be
old and still going to school
hey
sorry  i'm just a little upset
about my conversation with mr  dingwall
he was telling me how boring i was
and then charlie came in and he lit up like a christmas tree
well  there's your answer
to what
to getting an "a"
you should do your presentation dressed up like a baby
you know what  i might have a better idea
and i'd love to hear it
but the last of the mohicans just took off his shirt
gabe
hey  honey  you coming to gabe's basketball game
what for
because you're his father
or has he fired me from that too
you're still upset about this coaching thing
of course not
although according to the by laws of the denver junior
basketball association  article 17  section 9
the team is not allowed to take a vote and replace me
but i've let it go
good
oh
hi  dad
gabe
this is awkward
i didn't expect to see you here
in my home
gabe  honey
is there something you would like to say to your father
yeah
dad  i'm gonna need the whistle
hey  ange  what are you doing here
it's girls' night out
oh  you're kidding  tonight's not good for me
actually  i'm here to pick up p j
what's up  girlfriend
ooh ooh
are you going out with the moms
yeah  gonna have some appetizers
maybe do a little karaoke  just let our hair down
actually  jeannie rented a chick flick
so we're gonna hang at her place
a chick flick
i'm good to go
don't wait up
okay  that's just weird
no  what's weird is that i coach those kids for half a season and  
oh  let it go  bob
are you having fun out there  kiddo
mom  can you not see the scoreboard
it's 44 12  we're getting creamed
gabe  over here now
what
we never should have fired your dad
it was your idea
dude  i was hopped up on ice cream
well  it's too late now
or is it
you know what you gotta do
what are you saying
i'm saying it's time to hike up your skirt and fire your mom
hey  mom  we need to talk
sure  what's on your mind  honey
these things are never easy
you're firing me  aren't you
yep
well  at least one of us is undefeated
good luck  losers
hey  dad  old pal  what's goin' on
let me guess  
coach "fun" didn't work out
so now you're crawling back to dad
well  you know what  maybe i've moved on
fine  i'll go ask nick's dad
no no no  i'll do it  i'll do it
guys  men  come on  gather round
listen up  all right
we're gonna pull together
we're gonna play as a team
and we're gonna give it our all
and then we'll win
not a chance
but here's what we can do  
we can go out there and we can lose with dignity
lose with dignity  lose with dignity
yeah
hey  guys
come on back  it's only halftime
"animal farm" by george orwell
"animal farm" is a story about what happens
when idealistic animals take control of their farm
from the evil human owners
oof
now i'd like to introduce you to some of the animals
meet snowball the pig
charlie's a pig
i've died and gone to heaven
snowball  tell us about yourself
oh  i'm good hearted
and i believe that all animals should be treated fairly
and share their property equally
thanks  snowball
time to get back to the farm
bye  snowball
bye
but all is not well on the farm
because here comes  
napoleon  the conqueror pig
i am a troublemaker
i tell some of the animals they're better than others
that's right  i'm a bad pig
oh oh oh
that is my new screen saver
but thankfully  muriel the goat
calms things down with some of her words of wisdom
come on  muriel
i'm gonna see what's keeping her
what's the hold up
charlie's kinda gassy
might be those fish sticks we fed her in the cafeteria
they're talking back to me too
okay  i'd better wrap things up
come here  come here  yes yes yes
all right  okay
and here is muriel the fast talking goat
hey  kids
want to know what i have to say
read the book
so in the end the animals become
just as evil as the humans they overthrew
and now you can't tell the animals    from the humans
thank you  everyone
bravo  miss duncan
you made the book come alive
and in the most adorable way
i'm   i'm   i'm so sorry
ivy  help
oh  here come the sticks
well  now it smells like an animal farm
hey  mom  hey  dad
hey  how was story time at the library
it was okay  we read "everybody poops "
the title kind of gives away the ending
did charlie have fun
i don't know  we didn't sit together
anyway  i'm gonna be taking off again soon
going out with the moms again
no no  i'm done with that
i'm glad you're over it
me too
what was i thinking
what do i have in common with a bunch of women in their 30s
mom  dad  this is marge
the story lady from the library
we're going to tea
these are your grades on yesterday's final presentations
mr  gerkin  fit yourself with a hairnet
miss wentz
oh my gosh
miss duncan  your grade
and my dry cleaning bill
oh my gosh
two "b"s in a row
what if my mom starts to expect this
i'd better turn this into a "d"
mr  dingwall
yes
i just wanted to say thank you for my "a"
you earned it  for creativity
imagination and style  nicely done
thank you
now pretend that bell was a fire alarm
and the flames are upon us
just one more thing
you know  i had this crazy idea
that the reason you were being so tough on me
was because you didn't like me
it's crazy  right
because obviously you like me  right
teddy
not everyone in your life is going to like you
and the reason may have nothing to do with you
doesn't mean you've failed
just means you're human  okay
okay
but  you know  you never actually said if you like me  
okay
okay  if you like me  don't say a word
goodbye
ugh
well  charlie  no more fish sticks for you
but thanks for all your help with mr  dingwall
because of you i got an "a"  whoo
and i learned that not everyone is going to like me
and i'm okay with that
i'm working on being okay with that
but just in case
wish me good luck  charlie
go go go  come on  come on
have you seen the team
they went that away
come on  come on
have you seen the  
duncans
still can't find them
no
and i've searched the entire city
how was the so insanage done with gabe
you know  when i was coaching we didn't have this problem
