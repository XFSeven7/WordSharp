i'm not going just to see some stupid baby
who i don't even want anyway
i see what's going on  have a seat
i'm gonna tell you a story
when i was four  i got a baby sister
hated that girl from the first minute i laid eyes on her
i used to pull her hair
and call her names and tease her till she cried
but we grew up and one thing led to another
and after all these years i still can't stand her
how is that supposed to make me feel better
i didn't say it was going to make you feel better
i said i was going to tell you a story
now take that helmet off and let's go
what did you do to your head
gave myself a haircut
you like it
i want it documented that that happened before i got here
wait wait wait wait  no  hey hey

dr  singh
oh  it's about time  i  
wait a minute  i ordered batman

  and needs you at the hospital    i can't leave
i have to stay here and enjoy my son's birthday
who threw that  was it you  tyler
or the other tyler

how about we make a deal  okay
if you go to the hospital and take care of my mom
then we'll stay here and entertain the kids
and how are we gonna do that
we'll do my play for them
oh  it's a delightful fable about people from different worlds
who overcome their differences and become friends
i give it two thumbs up  good luck
hey  kids  who wants to see a play  huh
that is a yes from tyler
hey
if gretel gets hit with a football
there's gonna be one less tyler at this party
this should be good
