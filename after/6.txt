sorry  where's charlie
kitchen  with gabe
charlie did it
what in the world
well  charlie asked for a milkshake
like a good big brother  i decided to make one
then she forgot to put the top on the blender
so you put your baby sister in charge of an electrical appliance
and she let me down
teddy  get in here
mom  i'm on the   wow
gotta call you back
care to explain what's going on here
uh  a chocolate bomb went off
i asked if we could make milkshakes
and teddy did this
and then she started talking about her party again
that's what we call homework sometimes   a party   'cause it's so fun
okay  you know what  that's it
no t v   no computer  no video games
for the rest of the day
i think that's fair
and you're watching him
that's so unfair
and charlie
mom  i have to get ready for my party
that's just too bad  and what did i tell you about lying
it only works on dad
now both of you  clean this mess up
my poor little baby
i gotta give you a bath  mwah
or i could just lick you clean
today's all burnt toast
running late  and dad jokes
has anybody seen my left shoe
i close my eyes  take a bite
grab a ride  laugh out loud
there it is up on the roof
i've been there  i've survived
so just take my advice
hang in there  baby
things are crazy
but i know your future is bright
hang in there  baby

eveything turns out all right

good morning  dad
you gonna get to that lawn today
you know  when someone says "good morning "
the traditional response is "good morning" back
sorry
you gonna get to that lawn today
so where you off to
i'm meeting with some jingle writers
getting ready to shoot a new commercial for bob's bugs be gone
a jingle  that's like a song  right
that's right  a catchy little tune that sticks in your head
and drives you just a little bit crazy
you know emmett and i have a band  right
you know we have a lawn mower  right
don't you think you should give us a shot at writing your jingle
p j   come on  music's a great hobby for you
but i need a professional
come on  just give us a chance
all right  okay
if you guys wanna take a shot at it  knock yourselves out
you will not be sorry
and then one day when i accept my grammy for best exterminator jingle
i'm gonna say
"this one's for you  dad
and my girlfriend taylor swift
what up  tay tay "
what's wrong with you
no t v   no computer  no video games
i'm freaking out
why don't you read a book
sure  right after i clean my room
do you even know me
you're a strange little dude
where are you going
to the store  we're out of diapers
please take me with you
you wanna go shopping for diapers
no  but i will not stay here and have these machines mock me
again  a strange little dude
okay  read back what we have so far
okay  "jingle number one
written by p j  and emmett "
that's it
think  gotta think
oh  hey  my dad's name is bob
maybe we should think of things that rhyme with "bob "
how about blob  glob and slob
i'm doing a load of his whites
man  writing a jingle is harder than i thought
mom  we need some inspiration
well  lucky for you
i wrote quite a bit of poetry in high school
published five times in the school's literary magazine  
whatever
actually  i was thinking
you could inspire us with some sandwiches
my first piece or   back it up  
should i say my first published piece
is called simply "locker "
that's great  i'll take a ham and cheese  
"hey there  locker
filled with my books and papers
and secrets
i can't remember your combination
37 right  17 left
but then what
am i locked out
or are you locked in "
so good  so good
it's still so good
you wanna do this at my house
well well well
gabriel b  duncan
afternoon  hugo
the manager knows you
we have a history  yes
a word of advice  duncan  
you knock over a display or joy ride a shopping cart
and i will personally open a can of reddi mart's finest butt kick
hey  have you lost weight
just kidding
i'm watching you  punk
soda and mints  what are these for
i'm gonna make a soda geyser
you drop a mint into the bottle
and it makes this huge explosion
wow  that sounds so cool
put them back
how come you get to buy lip gloss and i can't buy this stuff
it's completely different
soda and mints won't make you look totally cute at a party
thank you very much
what's going on
why  it's gabe  i must be getting psychic
i didn't do anything
mm hmm  come on
receipt
there you go
huh  i'm seeing diapers
but i'm not seeing sunglasses  explain
explanation   we didn't get sunglasses
well  someone did
charlie did it
this time she really did do it
she must have grabbed these when we weren't looking
that's so funny
you see me laughing
there's nothing funny about shoplifting
in case you didn't notice  hugo  we're still in the store
unpaid items are considered stolen once they leave checkout
in case you didn't notice
we don't have cash registers in the parking lot
tell alice to call the police
the police  you're arresting a baby
or a very small person
we don't have all the facts yet
turn her to the left
don't you think it's a little ridiculous to take mug shots of a baby
that's procedure for shoplifters
turn her to the right
okay  charlie  smile for huge oh
sticks and stones may break my bones  
agh
are these the shoplifters
that's right  the perp is in the stroller
she's not a perp  she's a baby
still undetermined
i called the police  but they said this was low priority
and they wouldn't be here for three or four hours
three or four hours
alice  why can't you do anything right
it's not my fault  please don't yell at me
how many times have we been over this
whenever you tell me not to yell at you
it makes me want to yell at you
hi  as entertaining and twisted as this all is
can we please move it along  i have a party to go to
  you're going to a party    yes
that must be nice
nitwit  do not fraternize with the suspects
might as well make yourselves comfortable
looks like you're gonna be here a while
i'll stay here as long as you want
  there's t v  here    that's a security monitor
it's a screen and it's giving me pleasure
alice  register 2 needs nickels
hugo  i'm gonna bring nickels to register 2
i heard
gabe  we gotta get out of here
are you giving me permission to be bad
  yes    how bad
do whatever it takes
i've been waiting to hear those words my whole life
no whispering
hugo  i have to go to the bathroom
yeah
is this some kind of trick
it is   a magic trick
i drink stuff up here and it comes out down here
all right  let's go
and you  don't do anything stupid
like that
"like that "
all right  let's hear what you got
this first song is one of my personal favorites
it's called "jingle number one "

i was gonna call myself "bobzilla "
bobzilla
maybe five more minutes on the name  dad
well  it all worked out fine
i've got a nice life and a wonderful family
besides  you wouldn't want to see your dad on t v
beating up other guys  would you
that would be awesome
i know  so awesome  right

i used the pain of rejection to write another song
good for you  can i hear it
the bug man crushed my dreams
