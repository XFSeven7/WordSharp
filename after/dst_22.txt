so either you stop being weird or
yeah  that's the only way
that's why monkeys shouldn't fly
  planes     yeah
  yes     yeah
yeah  that was awe teous
  "awe teous"     yeah
i took "awesome" and mashed it with "righteous "
"awe teous "
dude  i love that
  hey  can i get something to drink    yeah  the kitchen's upstairs
  what do you think of jimmy     he's "gna teous "
  what    i mashed "gnarly" and "awe teous "
"awe teous" is already a mash up
just let him do it
charlie honey  drink your juice
  it'll make you feel better    no no
i don't think you should argue with me
i know a lot more words
may i have some water  please
sure  jimmy  coming right up
well  aren't you a cutie pie
i'd be lying if i said i hadn't heard that before
  i    i meant the baby     right  huh
oh  jimmy  i wouldn't get too close to charlie  she's
sick
whoa
she blasted me with snot
which was also the name of my last band
it's austin  tell him i'm not here
sorry  austin  gabe's not here
he's hiding under that blanket
actually  i came to see you
  you did     well  this just got interesting
i brought you some presents
an african orchid  i cultivate them myself
i also made you some soap
thank you
i was running low on orchids and soap
anything else
i also wanted to ask you something
  okay     will you go with me
go with you where
i'm asking you to be my girlfriend
wait  i    i'm sorry  what
i'm almost 16 and you're 11
and a half
i believe there's a question on the table
teddy  love knows no age
but it does know height
austin  i'm flattered  but i just came out of a relationship
"i have loved  let us see if that's all "
e e  cummings
"i'm not interested " t r  duncan
your words say one thing  but your eyes say another
okay  focus on my hands
they're pushing you out the door
this is not over  i shall return
you know  he's growing on me
  i got your message  what's the bad news    jimmy's sick
charlie sneezed on him
now he can't make the gig this weekend
  man  that's "awf able "   stop that
dude  we have got to find a new bass player and fast
  but where    i don't know
  dad     hey
oh sorry
i saw it here  i couldn't resist
  how'd you learn to do that     when i was in high school
i had my own band    the bob duncan experience
you were in a band  how come i never knew that
because whenever i start a story
with "when i was in high school " you zone out
i'm sorry  what
well  mr  d    you are the answers to our prayers
how would you like
band meeting
band meeting
that's not good
that's how i got thrown out
of the bob duncan experience
emmett  i don't want to be the loser who's in a band with his dad
a little quieter  guys
i know he's old
but what choice do we have
still hearing it
i guess you're right
dad
do you want to do the gig with us
yes  the experience continues
i'm back
for one gig only
for one gig only
"you are the light of my life  austin
p s   not to be used in non ventilated areas "
yep  that's my special fella
  hey     hey
okay  spencer  uh
this is awkward  but i have to tell you something
  sure  what is it     well  i heard your online status
says you're in a relationship
somebody told me  i don't remember who
so you should probably change that
  i'm just saying     actually  i did change it
  and then i changed it back    huh  okay look
i know you still have feelings for me
i get it  i have that effect on people
but really  it's time to move on  okay
teddy  my status isn't about you
i    oh
her name's nicole  we've had a few dates
she doesn't go to our school
well  that's   that's good for you
i mean it's good for both of us  actually
because i'm also in a relationship
  you are     yes
  cool  who is it     uh  austin
is his name
austin doesn't go to our school
he
got me this candle  whatever
ah  that's nice
yeah  he's thoughtful like that
ah  it's nicole
  i should probably take this     oh sure  go for it
i have to call austin anyway
once he's old enough to have a phone
hey  te    oh
please tell me you're not still obsessing about spencer
no no  i'm obsessing about some girl named nicole
who he's supposedly dating
but i don't think she exists
i just scrolled through all 452 of his friends
and there's not one nicole
you think he made up a fake girlfriend
just to get a rise out of you
oh  that is sad and pathetic
well  in certain situations
it's understandable
what's your fake boyfriend's name
austin
  oh teddy     i panicked
at least he's a real guy
i for you  my love   i
is that the lute
oh  i love the lute
sorry  austin  now's not a good time
teddy  go out with me
  no    then i will continue to serenade you
with every instrument at my disposal
but you should know
my father owns a music store
so what's it gonna take to make you go away
one date
okay  fine  let's get this over with
well  not now  i'm not dressed
i shall return saturday afternoon
  shall we say 1 00 ish     say whatever you want
our relationship ends at 3 00 ish
until then i bid you a gentle good morrow
i yahoo   i
dad  come on  let's have a look at you
huh  look at that
can i pass for a teenager
absolutely
just stay out of direct light
or any light
  is that a zit     yep  drew that on myself
makes me look younger  huh
ugh  putting a lot of pressure on one little zit  dad
okay  dad
  let's go over it one more time     oh  all right
my name is bo  i go to north high
and  if anybody asks  i have a bizarre medical condition
  that makes me look older     called
old man itus
we're good
oh  honey
want to go out with a teenager tonight
not with that zit
this is our date
your six year old cousin's birthday party
i couldn't show up without a date
that would be embarrassing
we wouldn't want anyone here to be embarrassed
oh  no  i've arranged a  i private  i  table for us
how romantic
i slipped the clown a few dollars
he'll be by shortly
come on  swing like you mean it
she's gonna be seven by the time we get out of here
it won't take that long
after the pinata  we have cake
  then we kiss and it's over     what did you say
we have cake
uh  it's your turn
ah  let's do this
open your bags  girls  this pretty rainbow's going down
yeah  that's what i'm talking about  whoo
  teddy     oh  spencer

who is pretty and  i real   i
and you're here with an 11 year old
pretty much

who will appreciate how wonderful you are
and for your information  spencer ain't it
  did you just say "ain't"     listen to me
i'm so passionate  i'm throwing grammar to the wind
yeah thanks  austin

you deserve somebody great too
i mean  somebody who's smart
kind and  well  11
shall we grab our goody bags  quick kiss
  and get out of here     what did you say
i said let's grab our goody bags
that's why monkeys shouldn't fly
planes
this is awful  we're totally bombing
they're not even paying attention to us
all right  guys  calm down
if there's anything i learned from the bob duncan experience
it's that if you want to get people to notice you
  you give them something to notice     how do you do that
