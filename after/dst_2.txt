mom and dad have been talking like that ever since you arrived
and if it's not over soon  i'm gonna go crazy wazy
  pj    what
what are you listening to
i downloaded a podcast on the history of ballet
  you like that    more than baby talk
would you like some fishy wishies with your cookie wookie
yes  i would  yes  i would
wait  guys  charlie isn't even here
no  widdle baby take a nappy wappy upstairs
so why are you guys still talking like that
i don't "weawy" know
i guess we're just kinda fried
well  we work all day  take care of a baby all night
work shift  baby shift
i've barely got time to make doo doo
well  when was the last time you guys had a night out
you know  like just the two of you   like a date
teddy made a funny
a funny wunny
seriously  you know what  it's saturday night
you two  you go out  have fun
and do something besides work
take care of the baby and make doo doo
well  it's nice to dream
but who's gonna take of charlie
hello  you've got three great babysitters right here
i'm glad i didn't hear that
i don't know  teddy  it's a really nice thought
but we're really not ready to go out without charlie just yet
  you guys want to see a magic trick    sure
  okay    prepare to be amazed
i could use a night out
day's all burnt toast
running late and dad says
has anybody seen my left shoe
i close my eyes  take a bite
grab a ride  laugh out loud
there it is up on the roof
i've been there  i've survived
so just take my advice
hang in there  baby  things are crazy
but i know your future is bright
hang in there  baby

eveything turns out all right

but trust me  it comes back all around
you're gonna love who you turn out to be
hang in there  baby
good luck charlie  s01e02  baby come back
all right  you guys have fun  stay out as late as you want
but not too much fun   we have enough kids already
i'm serious
okay  everyone  be good  have fun  love you
  yeah yeah    all right
hey  teddy  thanks for doing this
it's gonna be nice for your mom and i
to have some special time together
  bob  move your butt    i'm coming
all right  so we divide it up evenly
we each get to spend an hour with charlie
who wants to go first
i think you should go first
and second and third  since this was your idea
hey  i'm not doing this all by myself
you guys have to help out
fine  i'll go fourth
there is no fourth
i meant i shall go forth to the park to shoot some hoop
you want to go to the park so badly
then why don't you just take charlie
what's a baby supposed to do at the park
babies love parks  you can show her the duck pond
the blue sky  clouds
we're just gonna look at stuff  that's what tv is for
yeah heh hah  all right
this is great  whee
yes  whoo
what are you looking at  i was here first
hey  you can ride that duck
i couldn't ride the duck  i'd look silly on the duck
fine
hey there  charlie  are we having fun yet
all right
man  you seen a kid's birthday party around here anywhere
i'm the entertainment
i saw a bounce house of the other end of the park
a bouncy house  eh  great
another trip to the e r
who are you supposed to be anyway
plastic man  rubber man
no  those are all registered trademarks
i'm captain stretchy
there used to be a "cs" here  but it came off in the wash
so what's your super power
super elasticity
hey  look  there's a quarter
ah  forget it
not like it's a dollar  right
  hi    hi
oh  yeah  i like your taste in strollers
thanks  you too
  that baby's so cute    you too
oh  i mean yours too
  i'm emma    i'm pj
  who's this little guy    my brother
we're just out for our stroll  we do this every day
us too  like i always say  babies love parks
  would you like to sit for a bit    sure
so i saw you talking to captain stretchy earlier
oh  yeah  he was lost
  not much of a superhero  right    oh  he's the worst
we hired him for my brother's birthday party
  and he sat on the cake    that sounds awful
oh  it gets worse
the candles was lit  so he sat in the punch
that's so weird
i mean he looks like such a quality entertainer
you know  pj  i'm really impressed that
you take your baby sister to the park
my brothers would never do anything like that
i hope not  she is my sister
now watch closely  in this hand i have a quarter
and in the other  an ordinary egg
now i put them in this hat  spin them around a little
and presto
just out of curiosity
what was supposed to happen
i love this baby
anytime she wants to go to the park  sign me up
what happened to you
let's just say charlie made a friend  pjmade a friend
oh   and did either you or your friend bother to change a diper
there's no time for that  i was too busy talking to emma
  who's emma    a vision
an angel  the girl who's moved into my heart
did you tell her about the vacancy in your brain
  pj    what
you brought home the wrong baby
what  i did not
take a look  wrong parts
there's nothing wrong with those parts
how could you bring home the wrong baby
i'm sorry  i got a little distracted
emma is really cute
yeah  well  so was our sister
come on  let's go to the park and find her
relax  i got her number
then what are you waiting for  call her
wait a second
is it too soon
if i call now  she'll think i'm desperate
oh  you are desperate
good point
hello  is emma there
this is a chinese restaurant
sure  i'll hear the specials
she gave you the wrong number
who couldn't see that one coming
but i gave her gum and helped her change a poopy diaper
it was so romantic
well  what do we do now
oh no
hi mom  what up
yeah  everything's going great  why wouldn't it be
we're just having a grand old time here with  
baby
yeah  sure you can talk to him  her her
talk to mommy
what do you mean that did't sound like charlie
what  do you just think i'm making baby noises into the phone
mom  that's crazy
all right  bye  say bye  charlie
not that i'm in the position to criticize
but i was getting more monkey
come on  let's go to the park
and meet the girl who blew off pj
i'm there
  i don't see her    pj  what did she look like
she was hot  but what does it matter
maybe we should call someone
who do you call when you search a baby
captain stretchy
what is that
you're still here
every saturday and sunday all day long
stay in school  kids
just the guy we needed to see
i think you can help us
hey  kid  i'm just an entertainer
i can't get mommy and daddy back together
no  you don't understand
i was talking to a girl here earlier
and she said that you worked a party for her brother
so  i work lots of parties
where was the party where you fell on cake
you got three hours
this is really important  we need to find her
interesting situation  you kids need info
  and i need a mirdle    what is a mirdle
that's a man girdle  and they ain't cheap
yeah  neither is dry cleaning  apparently
her name's emma  did she come back to the park
well  maybe she did
and maybe she didn't
stop rubbing your fingers together and answer my question
he wants a bribe
i can't believe it
here
here is what i konw  her name is emma
i just told you that
i didn't say the information was fresh
yeah  i know the girl
she comes from a big family   seven  eight kids
for them i've been
astronaut pete  cowboy bob
  magic marv    yeah  you're familiar with my work
yeah  and it stinks
i'm just starting off
  and i'm a better magician than you are    oh yeah
you think this is easy  huh  here
turn that into a schnauzer
you can't do it  huh
maybe it's because you don't have the chops
well  stretchy  do you know where she lives
yeah  around here somewhere
  i'd know it if i saw it    great
now you help us tonight and we'll
get you into that mirdle tomorrow
oh  and you understand we're not actually
gonna put you into it  that you have to do by yourself
yeah  i get it
all right  come on  guys  we have to go find her
uh  hey   captain stretchy  away
  truck's this way    oh  okay
order whatever you want  honey  i get a discount here
this place is one of my best customers
not what you want to hear from an exterminator
oh  look at that
oh  fajitas
not that  the baby
a little baby in a stroller just like ours
yeah  okay  honey
this is supposed to be a night away from the baby
so let's come back
okay okay  i'm back
i'm back  just gotta run to the ladies' room
oh oh  hey  listen  while you're in there
could you check the traps
hola
adios
bob  will you go over and look at that baby
  i think it's charlie    what
you heard me  that is charlie
sweetheart  would you sit down  please
i will not sit down
a mother knows her own baby and that is my baby
honey  seriously  what do you think happened here
in the last hour somebody went over to our house
borrowed our baby then brought her out for chips and guac
i don't know  it's a big family
  maybe that's how they get their babies    sweetheart
i think you're just missing charlie
and you're having a little separation anxiety
oh  okay
you're right
crazy wazy
  i mean  that isn't possible  right    exactly
i'm just going to go to the ladies' room one more time
sit down
now let's enjoy the rest of our night out
at this very lovely restaurant
  okay    okay
i'm needed in the kitchen
  charlie    emma
  charlie    emma
  marco    polo
gabe  not helping
stretchy  is any of this looking familiar
maybe it does  maybe it doesn't
you are not getting any more money
no  i have night blindness
all i'm seeing is shapes
why didn't you mention that earlier
i needed a ride home
stop here
oh  great  mom's up
maybe i'll just hang with you kids
captain stretchy  away
  good night  stretchy    good night  stretchy
good night
now what
we didn't hit the streets on the north end of the park
pj  we can't keep driving around all night
it's over  we have to tell mom and dad
  but     no  it'll be okay
they know what to do  they always do
how am i gonna tell them i lost our baby sister
i'm the oldest  they're gonna think i'm the most responsible
pj  if it makes you feel any better
nobody thinks that
why do i always mess everything up
you know what  this could have happened to any of us
all right  probably most likely you  but  
this one  we're all in it together
thanks
hey  look
captain stretchy dropped his driver's license
175 lbs  my butt
there they are
all right  let's get this over with
do you think it would be better or worse
if we had the mariachi deliver the news
if it's in spanish  probably better
wait  i don't believe it
  that's emma    so that's charlie
yes  oh  we're saved
  not quite    hey  kids
  what now    i'll let you know when i think of it
mom  dad  hi
  hi    what are you doing here
we just realized you must be missing charlie
so we brought her
oh  teddy  you're not fooling me
  i'm not    nope
you spent a little too much time with charlie
and you're ready to hand her over early
well  i wouldn't say too much time
well  i am ready too  so let me at her
  gimme gimme gimme    mom  mom  mom
you're on a date  let me bring her to you
here  wait  now
well  all right
  hey  mom    hi  baby
  hey    hey  dad
  something i want to show you    what is it  honey
and now for my next trick
i'm gonna make a boy disappear
you know  you should be ashamed of yourself
you lead a guy on  make him think you have a connection
and you give him a fake phone number
you put it in wrong  that three is supposed to be a two
oh  my bad
so
you wanna get a table
my widdle baby  did you miss your mommy and daddy
yes  she did  yes  she did
oh  i never thought i'd be so happy to hear baby talk
teddy  this isn't charlie's binky  where did you get this
oh  well  that's actually a really funny story
see  what happened was
too loud  tell you later
well  charlie  now you're home safe and sound
and everything turned out okay
for you
it would have been okay for us too  but when we got home
mom started asking all these questions
and no one really had an answer to
the pee stains in the living room
and that's when the truth came out
and all the kids got into trouble
so the lesson is if you ever try
to pull anything over on mom
good luck  charlie
couldn't have said it better myself
in this hand i have a quarter
and in the other hand  an ordinary egg
now i put them in this hat
spin them around and
presto  now hold out your hand
wow  that's a great trick
how'd you do that
interesting situation
it seems you need information
meanwhile i need a new video game
what a chump
who you calling a chump  hey  get back here
