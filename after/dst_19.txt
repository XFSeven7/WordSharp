she's not a baby anymore
charlie  do you like your new bed
no
oh  it seems like just yesterday
i was complaining about giving up this room
aw  you miss your old room  honey
are you kidding
there's two floors between me and the boys now
this room is dead to me
hey  now that charlie's got her own bed
i can have a sleepover  right
okay  how did charlie's new bed
turn into you getting a sleepover
let me walk you through it
oh  i love it when he walks us through stuff
every time i ask you guys for a sleepover
you tell me i can't because there's a baby in the house
well  dad just said she's not a baby anymore
and he walked us through it
and it's my fault
look  if i don't have a sleepover soon
the other kids will stop inviting me to theirs
one night of kids at our house
and we get rid of gabe for a bunch of nights
take it  it's a good deal
  fine  you can have your sleepover    yes
come here  charlie  let's look at your new bed
you'll love it
no
i bet you're glad you spent two hours putting that together  huh
today's all burnt toast
running late and dad says
has anybody seen my left shoe
i close my eyes  take a bite
grab a ride  laugh out loud
there it is up on the roof
i've been there  i've survived
so just take my advice
hang in there  baby
things are crazy
but i know your future is bright
hang in there  baby
there is no maybe
eveything turns out all right
sure life is up and down
but trust me  it comes back all around
you're gonna love who you turn out to be
hang in there  baby
