now what
kai  old friend
master oogway
our battle ended
500 years ago
well  now i'm ready
for a rematch
took you long enough
you've grown stronger
500 years in the spirit realm
you pick up a thing or two
i have taken the chi
of every master here
no
yes
and soon i will have
your power  too
when will you realize
the more you take
the less you have
with your chi
i will finally be able
to return to the mortal world
and this time
you won't be there to stop me
it was never my destiny
to stop you
i have set another
on that path
then i will find him
and take his chi  too
justice is about to be served
whoo hoo
yee haw
we'll have two justice platters
please
um    three
three
and a few tofu buns
oh  the spicy noodle
soup for tigress
did you want extra
sauce with that
she wants it
on the side
on the side
on the side
go  dragon
warrior  you can do it
go  dragon warrior
defend the valley
dragon warrior
go  dragon warrior
defend the valley
yee haw
you guys aren't doing
the dramatic pose  are you
do we have to strike a pose
every time we land
you guys  never underestimate
the power
of a dramatic entrance
i've heard about some masters
who can win a fight
just by throwing open a door
oh
dramatic entrance
master shifu
the dragon warrior is correct
really  i was just making
uh  yeah  i mean  yeah  i am
before the battle of the fist
comes the battle of the mind
hence  the dramatic entrance
oh
nice dramatic entrance
what's the occasion
today will be
my final class
your final    wait
i didn't even know
you were sick
although you have been looking a little
i'm not sick
healthy
a little healthy  a lot  actually
my final class
because from now on
your training will be
in the hands
of the dragon warrior
what
me  teach
i mean  why not  tigress
she's always telling
everyone what to do
be quiet  po
you see what i mean
tigress is not
the dragon warrior
you are
come on
they're the five
what could i teach them
there is always something more
to learn  even for a master
for instance
let me show you
another move
the dramatic exit
what's that
wow  are you kidding me
where'd he go
master
he's gone  guys
it's cool
we await your
instruction  master
all you have to lose
is our respect
i mean  seriously
how bad can it be
very bad
very  very bad
okay  okay
let's switch it up
monkey
immovable mountain stance
yes  master
tigress
tornado back flip
yes  master
oh  no  fire
  fire
  stop
sorry  my fault
crane  go high
i mean low  low
ah  my claw thingy
uh  viper and tigress  do
uh  like  a totem pole
poison technique
uh  you two
do a swarming insect bite
with a yellow tail
yellow jacket  spicy tuna
i'm sorry
good job  po
ah
did you at least learn
a little something
yes
that you can't teach
and tigress is flammable
it turns out
yeah  that was
a complete disaster
uh  i'm glad
we're not po right now
what a loser
what was shifu thinking
what was oogway thinking
i think he heard us
i didn't hear
anything
uh  he said
you're a loser
i'm sorry  oogway
would you stop
doing that
how was your
first day teaching
humiliating
i heard
who told you
did tigress tell you
i heard from monkey
and crane  and mantis
and your dad
and mrs  chao from the gift shop
and those ducks
you just passed
and tigress told me
yeah  well  did she also tell you
that it'll never happen again
because i'm done
teaching or being humiliated
both  i don't know why you ever
thought i could teach that class
oh  i knew you couldn't
what  you set me
up to fail  why
if you only do
what you can do
you will never be
more than you are now
i don't wanna be more
i like who i am
you don't even know
who you are
what do you
of course i do
i'm the dragon warrior
and what exactly does
that mean  dragon warrior
hmm
it means  you know
just going around
and punching and kicking
defending the valley
and stuff
punching and kicking
you think that is what
the great master oogway
saw for you
a 500 year
prophecy fulfilled
so you could spend
your days kicking butt
and running through town
high fiving bunnies
yes
no
oogway saw greatness
in you  po
against my better judgment
more than you can see
in yourself
incredible power awaits you
power beyond anything
you can imagine
wow  what was that
that was chi
wow
what's chi
the energy that flows
through all living things
so you're saying
if i teach
i'll be able to do
cool stuff like that
no  i'm saying
if you teach
i'll be able to do
cool stuff like that
oh
mastering chi requires
mastery of self
oogway sat alone in a cave
for 30 years
asking one question
"who am i "
"who am i "
i'm lucky if
i get five minutes
before you interrupt
so now i have to sit alone
in a cave for 30 years
eventually
after you master teaching
teaching  there's no way
i'm ever gonna be like you
i'm not trying
to turn you into me
i'm trying to
turn you into you
turn me into me
wait a second
that makes no
almost there  shifu
just a little more confusing
and you'll be the next oogway
hmm    oh  uh
sorry  no offense
master oogway  i just
i'll let you get back
to your eternal peace
what is this place
uh    my brother's farm
ah
if i stepped on you
would you die
yes
the mortal realm
you hear that  oogway
i'm back
kai has returned
who
kai  general kai
supreme warlord of all china
huh
the jade slayer
master of pain
you may know me as
the beast of vengeance
uh    maker of widows
uh
okay  i used to
work with oogway
oh  master oogway
now  he was a great warrior
we've heard of
master oogway
okay  okay
enough  silence
find oogway's students
and bring them to me
by the time i am done
with them  oogway
there will be no one left who
will even remember your name
kai is coming
i am ready
to teach you a lesson
teach me  oh  no
it's the dragon teacher
yeah  he's so handsome
thank you for the compliment
no  please don't
teach me to death

stopping by for a little soak

where
a secret panda
village in the mountains
a secret panda
whoa
but how did you know
where i was
i received a message
that led me here

from the universe
whoa

this about a dragon warrior
how did you know
i was a dragon warrior

they're all talking
whoa  you're right
that's so scary
we should try that  too
maybe it'd be scary back at them
okay  but we gotta plan
what we're gonna say first
otherwise  it won't be scary
it'll just be stupid
i it's not them talking
you idiots   i
i it's me talking
through them  kai   i
who
okay  okay  okay  enough
did you see that
what just happened
the green smoke  just poof
and then poof
shifu  what was that
kai    kai    kai
nope  never heard of him
kai    kai
where is it
there's so much wisdom in here
i can't find anything
yes
behold
all the answers
will be found within
what  it's blank
are you kidding me
not again
wait  wait  hold on  sorry
oh  okay  here we go
it is written
in oogway's hand
"long ago  i had a brother   "
oogway had a brother
"in arms  in arms " sorry
he says  "brother in arms "
maybe you should just
unroll it all at once
"i was an ambitious young
warrior leading a great army "
i and fighting
by my side was kai   i
i my closest friend   i
i one day  we were ambushed   i
i i was badly wounded   i
i my friend carried me for days
looking for help   i
i until we came
to a secret village   i
i high in the mountains   i
i an ancient place of healing   i
i a village of pandas   i
pandas
i yes  pandas   i
i pandas who used
the power of chi to heal me   i
i they taught me
how to give chi   i
i oh  but kai wanted
the power all to himself   i
i he saw that what could be
given could also be taken   i
i i had to stop him   i
i our battle shook the earth   i
i until  finally   i
i i banished kai
to the spirit realm   i
i should he ever return
to the mortal realm   i
i he can only be stopped
by a true master of chi   i
"true master of chi"
like you
me  i can barely
make a flower bloom
i need at least
30 more years  and a cave
we need a chi master
he will
continue stealing
the chi of masters
until he has consumed it all
we have to think
of a way to stop him
he'll get more
and more powerful
with every master he defeats
there is
no choice  we fight
i can teach you  son
you can do this
of course  i'm a panda
that must be why
the universe sent you here
okay  so what do i
have to do
you have to
come home with me
what
to the secret village
yes  son
you must rediscover
what it is to be a panda
you have to learn
to live like a panda
sleep like a panda
eat like a panda
those 103 dumplings
i was just warming up
i've always felt like
i wasn't eating up
to my full potential
no  you can't take po
away from me  no  no
i want a second opinion
shifu  open another
scroll or something
i think he should go
fine  a third opinion
monkey  viper  tigress
dad  you heard what
shifu said oogway said
this guy can only be stopped
by a master of chi
and i can only master chi
by knowing who i really am
well  i'm a panda
i'll pack you a lunch
for the road
do you really think
po can master chi in time
doesn't matter
what i think
it only matters
what the universe thinks
so  that's a "no"
master  what are
we going to do
you are going to find
out where kai is
follow the trail
of those jade creatures
but do not engage
for with every foe he faces
kai becomes stronger
why me  is it
because i asked
no  it is because
you can fly  go
should have kept
your beak shut
and take mantis
oh  man  is it
because i
yes
oh  lunch break
oh
you don't need
to ask me twice
dad
yes
dad
yes
what are you doing here
what am i doing
getting a backache
did you have to step
on every rock
no  i mean
why are you here
what was i supposed
to do  huh
what if the pandas
don't have food you like
you're never gonna be able
to save the world
on an empty stomach
i consider my presence
mission critical
oh    yes  about that
we can't share the location of
the village with others  so
well  you think i can't
keep a secret  huh
i raised po for 20 years
before i finally
told him he was adopted
seriously
yeah
okay  i guess it would be
cruel to make you fly back
you can fly
i'm a bird  po
we're here
sure looks like a long
ways up there
and my son hates stairs
so  let's go home
we're pandas
we don't do stairs
i've waited my whole life
to hear those words
rats
whoa    huh
this is the secret
panda village
no wonder
you keep it a secret
if i lived here
i wouldn't tell anyone either
now you can "whoa "

she was the total package
smart  beautiful
tremendous appetite
she was the love
of my life
and then  just when i thought
i couldn't get any luckier
along you came
my little lotus
i really had it all
until that one moment
when i lost everything
dad
you don't have to worry about
losing me ever again
okay
let me get
some of that
it's from
the eastern province
master lizard  master ox
master eagle  all of them
in every village
from the sea to here
every master in china
has vanished
maybe they are
all at a party
monkey
i didn't get
invited either
kai has taken their chi
we are all that stand
between him
and the knowledge
oogway left in our care
the villagers  evacuated
done  master
crane  mantis
still nothing
wait  it's them
no
kai
nice
very tacky
how dare you set foot
on these grounds
look at you pathetic fools
groveling at the feet
of oogway the magnificent
you are not fit
to speak his name
i am not fit  little kitten
i fought by his side
i loved him like a brother
and he betrayed me
now i will destroy
everything he has created
go
how's that
for a little kitten
i will not let you
destroy oogway's memory
why not  he destroyed mine
mantis
it is me  your bestie
sorry  tigress
sorry  sorry  sorry
sorry
shifu

no
you must warn po
master  please
i will show you the true
power of chi  brother
no
oogway  forgive me
hmm  what do
you say  oogway
do you forgive him
you may have destroyed
the jade palace
but you will never succeed
there will always
be someone to stop you
who  the panda
his chi is strong
but it won't be enough
he will meet
the same fate as you
no
and so will every panda
in that village
yes
po  i hope
you're ready
dance  lotus  dance
he's so handsome
ooh
hi
that's a panda hug
hey
po
tigress
who's she
who is that
big stripy baby
what are you
doing here
kai attacked the valley
he's taken every
master in china
including shifu
and the others
it's all gone  po
everything  everyone
everyone
everyone
how's my restaurant
we'll talk later
and now he's on his way here
he's after you  po
he's after all pandas
how long do we have
not long
please  tell me
you've mastered chi
here  take the baby
dad  dad
okay  who belongs
to this one
you need to teach me
the secret chi technique now
no  no  i'm afraid
you need more time
everyone  go get your things
let me help you with that
i don't have more time
i need to learn it now
sorry  you're not ready
okay  pack everything
  i am ready
  not quite
what are you talking about
i've done everything you've asked
i've mastered napping
sleeping in
hammocks  hot tubs
i am totally at one
with my panda parts
now why won't
you show me
because i don't know it
you what
i don't know it  okay
no one does
maybe we used to
but not anymore
you lied
no  i
yes
wh    why
to save your life
i find out some blade swinging
maniac is coming for you
what am i supposed to do
just let that happen
yes  i'm the dragon warrior
facing maniacs  that's my job
but because of you
i left the valley unprotected
i left my friends unprotected
and now they're all
they're all
and you would have been  too
i lost you once
i am not going
to lose you again
i can't
you just did
mom  pick me
oh
po  i'm so worried for you
that i can't even enjoy
being right about everything
now run  run  run  as fast
as those chubby legs can go
run  there's
nowhere to run
but what are
you going to do
i'm gonna stay
and fight that monster
po  he may be a monster
but he's still your father
not him  kai
no
hungry
no  i    not really
well  maybe just one
you know  you weren't
the only one who was lying
oh
i didn't really come along
because i was worried po
would go hungry
i was worried about you
worried that i'd go hungry
no
i was worried
you'd steal po from me
i'd what
i know  that was crazy
but i realize having you
in po's life doesn't
mean less for me
it means more for po
oh
well  i'm not in his life
not anymore
your son got mad at you
welcome to parenthood
you don't understand
i lied to him
he'll never forgive me
i lied to him for 20 years
he still thinks
he came from an egg
sometimes  we do the wrong
things for the right reasons
look
he's hurt
he's confused
and he still has
to save the world
he needs both his dads
this isn't going to work
it has to
you're not
thinking straight
i am
you're not
i am
no
yes  i am
no
i've seen kai
i've seen what he can do
but he hasn't seen
what i can do
the wuxi finger hold
it's my best move
i just have to get to kai
grab his finger
and then skadoosh
back to the spirit realm
he has an army
of jade warriors
everything they see
he sees
so there's no
sneaking up on him
you will never get
close enough
it's gonna work
he can only be stopped
by a master of chi
oh  you sound just like shifu
with the  "chi  chi  chi "
"chi this  chi that "
"chi  chi  chi "
i'm not a master
of chi  okay
i don't know if i'm
the dragon warrior
i don't even know
if i'm a panda
i don't know who i am
you're right
there's no way i can
stop him and his army
unless you had
an army of your own
you
not just me
us
all of us
i finally found my son
after all these years
it's going to take a lot more
than the end of the world
to keep us apart
but you don't
even know kung fu
then you will teach us
what  i can't
teach you kung fu
i couldn't even teach tigress
and she already knows kung fu
po  i know i'm the last guy
you wanna trust right now
but you gotta believe me
we can do this
we can learn kung fu
we can be just like you
what did you just say
uh
"we can do this"
no
"we can learn kung fu"
after that
uh    "we can be
just like you"
yes
we can
no  you can't
but you don't have to be
that's what shifu meant
i don't have to
turn you into me
i have to turn you into you
that doesn't
make any sense
i know
thanks  dads
you're welcome
i'm gonna do something i never
thought i'd be able to do
i'm gonna teach kung fu
