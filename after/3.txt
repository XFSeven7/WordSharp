when i tell you to do something  i expect you to do it
get off my back  woman
you want me off your back  i can arrange that
charlie  those are our neighbors  the dabneys
they've been married a long time
hey  pj  i just kicked the football into the dabneys' backyard
will you go get it
no way  they're going at it again
  well  what about the football    who cares
it's gone  kiss it goodbye
well  i'm glad to hear you say that
because it was your football
ha  i warned you
that's what you get for being a bad husband
and now you're dead
is somebody out here
who's out here
  where's the football    forget the football
mrs dabney just murdered mr dabney
what
i heard her talking to his corpse
it was chilling
just so i'm clear  you didn't get the football
  i'm serious  gabe    come on
mrs dabney may be a mean  vicious  cruel
horrible  nasty old witch
but she'd never do something like that
  you don't believe me    no
fine  fine  i'll prove it
come here  gabe
hello
is mr dabney home
he    can't come to the phone
interesting
who is this
uh   i'm some sort of salesman
gabe  is that you
why would you assume my name is gabe
because i have caller id
oh  then yeah  it's gabe
hey
whoo  she's cool under pressure  i'll give her that
  pj  she's not a murderer    i heard what i heard  gabe
why don't you believe me
because you're you and you get things wrong
what are you saying  that i'm dumb
well  no
you're just not very
  thinky    thinky
gabe  why would you say something like that
'cause mom said i can't call you dumb
it is so pathetic
my mom's in the kitchen texting away
gosh  i'd hate to be on the other end of that conversation
who are you texting
  your mom    i am so sorry
look  i promise i'll get her out of your hair
no  it's okay  your mom's cool
my mom is what
and she's really funny
my mom is what
wait  that's her again
what are you talking about with my mom
  nothing    nothing
that's what we say to her
hold on  i have to "lol" her
okay  well "lol" has officially lost all meaning
i'm sorry  is this a problem for you
no  i just think it's a little bit inappropriate
inappropriate  now you sound like my mother
well  how would you know what your mother sounds like
you've been spending so much time with mine
what are you getting so whacked about
you didn't want to text her
well yeah  that's because she's my mom  not my friend
wouldn't you be weirded out if i was texting your mom
yes  because she doesn't have a cell phone
look  t  if you're not cool with this
i'll just stop
no no  i don't care  i mean  it's a free country
go crazy   text my mom
im my dad  video chat my aunt helen
ooh  your aunt helen
your mom says she is da bomb diggitty
my mom really said "da bomb diggitty"
well  i may have added that part
pj  you've got to stop watching these mysteries
not until i figure out how to catch mrs dabney
these old movies are gonna help me do that
that's like saying cartoons will teach you how to run through walls
learned that the hard way
mom  can you get that
sure  i'll get the door  i am a lot closer to it
hello  mrs  dabney
  hello    come on in
heads up  killer in the house
what have they done this time
for once  nothing   that i know of
it's nice to see you too
i'd like to speak with your husband  please
i'll let him know you're here
i'm a texter now
i'm texting
really speeds things up
somebody lose a ball today
possibly  did you lose anything today  mrs dabney
honey  what does this mean  "somebody's at the doof "
omg
i meant "door"
ttyl
talk to you later
what can i do for you  mrs dabney
  you're an exterminator  right    pest control specialist
maybe you can help me with a problem i'm having
how do i get the smell of death out of my house
will you turn that tv down
so you think something died in your house
oh  i know something is dead
well  first thing you're gonna have to do
is locate and dispose of the carcass
i suppose you could get mr dabney to do that
oh  mr dabney won't be doing anything around the house for a while  
a long while  he's    gone
you know what  would you just turn it off
what's wrong with your boys today
i just got here
um  all right  old trick of the trade
get yourself some maple syrup  put it on the stove
let it simmer   that should get rid of the smell
thank you  that's very useful information
bye  boys
"itbootp"
what does that stand for
in the bathroom out of toilet paper
tmi
too much information
i can't believe it  but you were right
mrs dabney did it
wow  this is what it feels like to be right  huh
i like it
too bad somebody had to die  but  
  what are we gonna do now    i have to tell mom and dad
they're never gonna believe you
i didn't believe you and i'm 10
well  then we need proof
and i have to warn you  gabe  until we get that proof
our lives may be in danger
i thought we turned that off
what'd you get for number nine
switzerland
well  that's odd since we're doing math
  hi    hi
mom  what are you doing here
you weren't supposed to pick me up at five
teddy left a message and said to come by early
something about "chilling"
yeah  that's right
thought your mom and i could chill for a little while
really  this is what you're doing
yeah well  this is what we're doing
so if you will excuse us
  we'd like a little privacy please    sure  fine
i'll be in the kitchen with your mom
come on over
sit down next to me  girlfriend
what's this all about  is ivy in trouble
oh  no
is she back on the chocolate
no no no  ivy's fine
i just wanted to spend some time with one of the cool moms
  you    oh
okay
i love your outfit  where'd you get it
my closet
you are so funny  i bet you get that a lot  right
  no    no
are we done chilling
yes  yes  we are  because it is time to par tay
let's get jam started
yeah  come on  miss w  let your freak flag fly
yeah
that's kind of loud  could you lower that  please
yeah
a little bit more
a little bit more
perfect
uh  hey  want to do something fun
i like making these video diaries for my baby sister
so how about we say hi
hi  charlie  it's teddy here
with my new friend mrs wentz
hello
let's see how we look
ooh  i'd date us  wouldn't you
i'm married
okay  that's enough of that
now  you know what  we've been doing a lot of my fun stuff
tell me   tell me about you  what do you like to do for fun
  i like to knit    ooh
that is so cool because    because    anything else
  i like to read    oh  yeah  me too
what kind of stuff do you like to read
kniiting magazines
that's awesome  i mean  we have so much in common
you know  once i start reading knitting magazines
which you're pulling out of your bag
okay  she's gone
here's how this is gonna go down
i'm gonna jump over the fence  you hand charlie to me
  and then     or i could just walk through the gate
like this
you did know there was a gate  right
yes  would i be riding on top of it if i didn't
now what
now it's time to be in operation "catch a killer"
while babysitting
so  what are we looking for
evidence  clues  a weapon
mr dabney's rotting corpse would be nice
oh my gosh  that's horrible
  what  what do you see    that paint color  
it's so wrong for that room
  i watch a lot of design shows    focus
  look  something's moving    where
by the couch  right   right there
  it's a baby    it's charlie
no  it's not  charlie's right over  
inside the murder house
okay  try to stay with me now
because we're going to get a little wild
instead of knit one  purl two
we kick it up to knit one  purl three
is that even legal
i don't know
but i just like living dangerously
okay  i'm gonna go get something to drink
  do you want anything    oh  not now
i'm in the zone
what you doing in here
giving up
did she suck the life out of you
yeah  pretty much
now you see why i'm always at your house
yeah  i'm so sorry
i was being selfish with my mom
and even though i think it's a little bit weird
you can text her as much as you want
i think i got a better idea
and then  get this
if you type in a semicolon parentheses
  you get a     winky face
i have got to get a cell phone
i like it  you put our moms together
and they leave us alone  you are brilliant
see  this is why we're bffs
i'm brilliant and you recognize it
now if i type "rotf "
do i actually have to roll on the floor
i thought the same thing at first
but no
this'll get her out
charlie loves things that rattle
okay  girl  charlie  come on
get the keys  get the keys
aw  man  i dropped the keys
fantastic
now we can't get into our house either
  i don't see charlie  where'd she go    oh  there she is
wait  what is she putting on her head
a dishtowel
mrs dabney's underpants
oh
  man    oh ho
come on  we gotta get her out of there
yeah  come on
what are you doing in my yard
we're here to help you with your groceries
you want to be helpful
i like to try new things
here  let me give you a hand with that
i can handle the groceries
but as long as you're here
i could use your help with something inside
inside  perfect
let me just put my groceries down
  take your time    yeah  yeah
  where's charlie    uh  
  look behind the curtains    okay
  nothing    there she is
oh  i've got you
yeah
i don't want it
stop it
where did that baby come from
charlie  i've been holding her the whole time
  you have    that's sad  mrs dabney
they say the eyes are the first things to go
we gotta go
not so fast  put the baby down
i need you to carry something out for me
i want you to take this trunk out to my car
it's too heavy for me
why  what's in it
something i should've gotten rid of a long time ago
  where are you taking it    to the dump
that's where you take trash  isn't it
trash
mr dabney wasn't trash  he was a person
what are you talking about
you know exactly what i am talking about
you bumped off your husband and stuffed him into that trunk
  is that what you think     that's what we know
what is she   oh  watch it
she's kill crazy
you want to see what's in here
take a look
whoa  it's mr dabney
and he's already decomposed
that's not mr dabney
that's a skeleton he used in his classroom
he used to be a science teacher
but i heard you screaming at him
you called him a bad husband and then you said
"and now you're dead "
oh  you must have heard me talking back to someone on my soaps
soaps
soap operas    on tv
like the one they should name after you two  
"the young and the clueless "
well  if mr dabney isn't dead  then where is he
at his mother's probably wishing he was dead
well  then how do you explain the smell of death you asked my dad about
dead possum in my dryer vent
well  then how do you explain  
that's pretty much it  i guess
just one more question  
do you have any cookies
get out
what are my underpants doing in the fireplace
gotta go
dat da da da  here she comes
coolest mom in the world  yay
okay  what's all this
oh  just showing charlie how much i love you
oh  i love you too  sweetie

oh  so mom  i've been thinking  
maybe you and i should start texting
i mean  you are a pretty cool mom  right
oh  sorry  honey  those days are over
text thumbs
text thumbs  that's our mom  
from cool to embarrassing just like that
all right  good luck  charlie
hey  guys  better make your friend a sandwich
he's looking a little thin
where'd you guys get that thing
mrs dabney was throwing it out
yeah  it belonged to mr dabney  he was a science teacher
mr dabney wasn't a science teacher  he was a music teacher
what
  that means     this is  
mr dabney wasn't a music teacher
you're thinking of   of mr dixon across the street
oh  that's right  mr dabney was a science teacher
the boys seem a little jumpy to you
ah  i just got here
