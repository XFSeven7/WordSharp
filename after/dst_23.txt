that was you blowing my mind
she was the only one who tried out
well  have you found a mom yet
oh  no  all the amy candidates are out on the porch
oh  okay  whatever
i wasn't even thinking about that  really
is that the mail i hear  i'm just gonna go check and find out
sorry  girls  the video sheet's been canceled
yeah  the duncans have head lice
okay  first let's
hey  where'd everybody go
beats me
anything mom can do for you
wow  you're unbelievable  okay  well
seeing as i have no other choice  would you
yes
okay  here we
mom  come on  i want to get started
  coming      i spend more time
waiting for that woman
mom  why did you change
  the script says amy's in scrubs      oh  honey
i learned in college theater
that the script is really just an outline
okay  all right  everyone  here we go
bob and amy  you're on the couch
teddy enters from over there  now remember  guys
this is just a rehearsal so use your scripts
and action
"teddy  can you come here a minute "
"teddy crosses to the couch  nervous
'am i in trouble'    question mark "
no no no  kimmy  just the lines  honey
not the other stuff  okay
and action
"teddy  we need to talk to you "
"am i in trouble "
"well  i'll just say it
  your mother's gonna have a baby "     okay  can we stop
can we stop  i'm sorry
these words    they just don't fit into my mouth comfortably
but it's what happened  it's exactly what you said
the day you were supposed to be wearing scrubs
okay  valid point  but do we want to make it real
or do we want to make it good
i want to make it before my battery dies
yeah  well  that new bike sure is a beauty
sure is  dad
  all right  have fun    okay
  gabe  before you go      yeah
     one quick question      mm hmm
you know that garage door remote that charlie had
  mm hmm    how do you think she got that down from the cupboard
  maybe you should ask charlie     yeah  well
you know i can't do that
oh  because she can't talk yet
  yeah      yeah  that is a bummer
yeah  it sure is
all right  you know what  i'll see you later
okay
you know what  just one more thing
mm hmm
you know  i don't even think
that remote works from the kitchen where charlie was
dad  what are you trying to say
are you accusing me of something
no  i just wanna know when you're gonna be back
oh  half an hour  can i go now
of course you can  gabe
you've always been free to go
okay
okay okay  there she is
now i'm going to prove to you that she likes me
  and not you     okay  okay
  hi      hi
  hi       hi
so far it's a tie
okay  i know we both have a lot to offer
but you're gonna have to choose between us
oh  i choose p j
okay  let's try that again
and remember it's a multiple choice question
my choice is still p j
i'm sorry  i can't go out with you
i wouldn't do that to emmett  pals before gals
  thanks  man    you'd do the same for me  right
yeah  let's go with that
wait a minute  i know what's going on here
  you think i'm nina     you're not
no  i'm tina  that's nina
twins
wait  what are we doing
and then i could say
"teddy girl  mama's having a baby child "
right  right  isn't that better
doesn't it make more sense
that amy would tell teddy about the baby
"mama's having a baby child"
well  teddy  i'm just trying to find
the emotional truth to the piece
no thank you
okay  fine  you want me to be a robot  i'll be a robot
i'll be a robot
am i in trouble
no  no no no no no
nobody's a robot  we're doing the script as written
okay  places everyone
and action
teddy  can you come here a minute
am i in trouble
teddy  we need to talk to you
well  i'll just say it
your mother's gonna have a baby
a what
a baby  you're gonna have
a new little brother or sister
  oh    now what are you doing
i just felt the baby kick
no  no no no
that's impossible  the baby doesn't have feet yet
okay  you know what  i'm just trying
to figure out the mix of emotions that i was feeling that day
you know  the excitement  the confusion
the fear  the hormones
yeah  do you know what i was feeling that day
it was "why are you having another baby
you barely have time for the three kids you have now "
was that in the script  because i'm lost
teddy honey
what was that
i'm sorry  mom  i shouldn't have said that
well  is that really how you felt
were you really mad that we were having another baby
  yeah  i kinda was     why didn't you say something
mom  what was i supposed to say
charlie was on the way  you were all so excited
excited  i didn't know how we were gonna make it all work
  i was terrified    really  'cause you didn't show it
that's because i'm a really great actress
come here  sit down
do you still feel that way
like we don't have enough time for you
actually  today i thought maybe you had
a little bit too much time for me
no  seriously
i don't know how you're doing it
but you guys are doing a great job
well  that's because we're not doing it alone
and one of the big reasons it works is you
the boys help out too
but you're right  it's mostly me
look  teddy  in the future
if ever you're feeling something  you've got to tell me  okay
come here  come here
i want us to always be honest with each other
okay  i'll be honest with you
say the lines as written or you're fired
aww
what's the matter  gabe
  um  dad        are you okay
you look shook up
  wheelie's back     i know  isn't it great
yay  um
how did you find him
oh  i came home from work
i saw that kid jake on your bike
so i called the cops and they arrested him
they arrested jake
but he's just a kid
ooh  he won't be when he gets out
  what      what's wrong  son
something bothering you
um    no
no  well  something's bothering me
because here's what i think really happened
first  you sold your bike to jake
and then you pocketed the money
then you opened the garage door
using the keypad
finally  you grabbed the remote
from the kitchen cabinet
and you planted it on charlie
interesting theory  but it doesn't prove a thing
you're right  you're right
i didn't have any hard proof
but i kept thinking  thinking
and thinking
and then a bell went off
  is gabe here      no
tell him jake wants his  10 back
this bike is a piece of junk
and that's when all the pieces fell into place
all right  you got me
now what happens
ask your mother
back from the bike store
charlie  your brother has something he would like to say to you
go ahead  gabe
charlie  i'm sorry i tried to frame you
aw  remember the first time i said that to you
like it was yesterday
and now here is a little i'm sorry present from your brother
okay  bring it in
  oh     yay
yeah  we exchanged gabe's new bike for this one
  thank you     you're welcome
charlie  there you are on your very first bike
yeah yeah  teddy girl
mama's baby child has a new tricycle
it's pink and red and it's got little stickers on it
yup  and there's mom stealing your very first spotlight
good luck  charlie
i feel so bad  i just can't tell them apart
  it is hard     and i don't want to offend them
well  you just have to find one little thing that's different
what do you think
i have no idea  and i'm married to one of them
hey  uh  dads
can i have five bucks
huh  i love having two dads
unbelievable  we'll never figure it out
wait  wait
yup  that's my guy
i today's all burnt toast  i
i running late  and dad says  i
i has anybody seen my left shoe  i
i i close my eyes  take a bite  i
i grab a ride  laugh out loud  i
i there it is up on the roof  i
i i've been there  i've survived  i
i so just take my advice  i
i hang in there  baby    i
i things are crazy  i
i but i know your future is bright  i
i hang in there  baby  i
i there is no maybe  i
i everything turns out all right  i
i sure life is up and down  i
i but trust me  it comes back around  i
i you're gonna love who you turn out to be  i
i hang in there  baby   i
good luck charlie  s01e23 pushing buttons
