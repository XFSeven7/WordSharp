whoa
i am getting a very powerful vibe from you
oh sorry  i've been sitting in a hot minivan for four hours
oh  sweetie  no  no no no  i mean i'm a psychic
 really  you're a psychic   yeah
'cause  no offense  but you kind of look like a normal person
did you know i was gonna say that
did you know i was gonna say  i that   i
it doesn't work that way
and yes  i did
would you like a free reading
you tell me
i'll give you one anyway
give me your hands
oh  this trip is going
to be a very important one for you
i'm seeing you will have two left feet
and    that's odd
now i see there is a bear in your room
and now i see why you give free readings in the lobby
and finally
i see you will come face to face
with the love of your life
oh whoa  okay  no thanks
i    i just got out of a relationship
with this guy named spencer
so i'm not really looking to meet anybody
you think it's up to you  that's cute
uh  excuse me  i have to take this
take what
hello
oh  what a surprise  not really
come on  don't you want to go snowboarding
i'm doing it right now  check this out
i just broke my neck
sweet
so what are you gonna do all day
room service
does that answer your question
your order  sir
french fries  potato chips and onion rings a la mode
mr  starkwell
gabe
you two know each other
mr  starkwell was my third grade teacher
gabe is the reason i quit teaching
and he's the reason i went to summer school
you went to summer school because you've got a mouth on you
sir
hey  remember me
did i have you for third grade too
yeah
we had two great years together
well  looks like the foot's on the other shoe now  isn't it
don't you mean the shoe is on the other foot
your days of correcting me are over  marvin
oh  this is gonna be fun
what  oh no  i brought two left boots by mistake
wait    two left feet
 huh  that's weird   what's weird
well  i met this psychic in the lobby
and she made some crazy predictions
but one of them just kind of came true
i went to a psychic once  she was dead on about me
said i was gonna be famous
but that hasn't come true
yet
but mine was crazy
she said i'd come face to face with the love of my life
well  it could happen  teddy
mount bliss is a magical place
well  don't get too excited
she also said there would be a bear in my room
oh  run for your lives
okay  that's just weird
really  i thought it was kinda cute
all right  we'll go take it back
wow
i could look at that view forever
okay  that's enough
hmm
never seen this trail before
cool
all right  yeah
ahhh
am i in heaven
 hello   hi
bye
hey  hey honey  guess what
we're not actually married  would you like to grab some lunch
what did you just say
you want to grab some lunch
no  before that
oh  it turns out our wedding ceremony wasn't actually valid
you feel like mexican
what do you mean we're not actually married
whoa whoa  i was asking around about judge lawson
and the guy at the front desk tells me
he was like some kind of con man
apparently he did fake marriages all the time
but he said we were perfect for each other
apparently it was just part of his scam
you know  there's this great fondue place i read about
would you stop talking about food
this is serious  i mean  we're not really married
well  according to the universe
of course we are  honey
according to the state of colorado  not so much
 oh hey  psychic lady   oh hi
so i've been looking around all day for the love of my life
and i haven't found him yet  so when's that gonna happen
oh gosh  i don't know
psychic prediction is not an exact science
ha  it's not a science at all
right  can i at least have a little more info
like is he hot or not
not that it matters  but please say "hot "
all i can tell you is keep your eyes open
okay  well  they're open
and they're starting to see that this is a bunch of
hi
hi
i'm teddy
i'm brandon
wow  so i guess it's true
what's true
well  you    i mean  us
i mean  i didn't believe it
but then i had two left boots
which aren't actually feet
but they're where feet go in
when you need something to walk in
so in a sense  they're feet
 what   okay okay
i probably sound a little bit crazy right now
but you would too if a psychic told you
there was a bear in your room
which there was    sort of
oh  and in my room  not in your room
i don't know anything about your room
i'm gonna go now
i'm not crazy
seriously  i'm not crazy
for dinner i would like the lobster thermometer
it's lobster thermidor
what did i say about correcting me
that if i did it again  you were going to
well  i can't say i didn't warn you
now chop chop and get me my lobster
i know this is none of my business
but you're running up quite a bill here
what do you mean
you don't know what room service is  do you
yeah  i want things and you bring them to me
for an additional charge
wait  it costs money
a lot of money
shall we see how much money
let's go to my favorite channel
the bill channel
oh mama
300
i don't have that kind of money
looks like you're in quite a pickle
which  by the way  are  8
mom and dad are gonna ground me forever
perhaps we can make some kind of arrangement
what do you mean
i have to be a bellman
bellboy

am i in heaven
why does he keep saying that
i don't know  but it's so cute
so this is your cabin  huh
yep

especially ones with sparkling blue eyes
and beautiful blonde hair
this is a lucky day for everyone
do you need to call your family
and let them know you're okay
nah  i'm good
so you girls live here alone
 no  our pa lives with us   oh
 but he's away on business   oh

you poor baby  you're freezing
i want to run him a hot bath
 i will   no  i will
oh girls  girls  i'm gonna need more than one bath
hey  mom  can i borrow your pink scarf
sure  honey  why are you all dolled up
because i think i may have met the love of my life
except i acted crazy and scared him away
so now i have to get super cute and hang out in the lobby
so he can fall in love with me
mom  i've got to tell you  he is the perfect guy
well  okay  tell me all about him
okay  well  he's really cute
his name is brandon
and that's all i know
he does sound perfect
hey  honey  hey
why aren't you dressed  i thought we were going skiing
no  change of plans
the front desk found a justice of the peace
who's going to marry us this afternoon
what are you talking about
um  honey  i want you to brace yourself
okay  your father and i aren't actually married
oh my gosh
i forgot to floss
 so should we go get married   yeah
but can't it wait till we get home
well  i just thought it would be really romantic and special
if we did it here
you know  where we thought we did it 19 years ago
but i already bought the lift tickets
oh  come on  honey  we're on vacation
come on  i want to enjoy myself
oh okay  so being married to me
isn't something you'd enjoy
i'm not enjoying it right now
fine  don't marry me then
well  all right  fine  i won't
you won't last five minutes without me
oh yeah  you just watch me
 have you seen that     it's around your neck
thank you
starting right now  baby
tell us more about your gold medal
well  it's gold
and it's made out of metal
can we get you anything else
yeah  why don't you get some marshmallows
some chocolate and some graham crackers
 what for   so we can make s'mores
what are those
girls  girls  girls
there's so much i have to teach you
 i'll get them   no  i'll get them
 i'll get them   ah
whoa  who are you
who are you
i asked you first
i don't like boys sniffing around my girls
you must be pa
wow
you're bigger than everything
get out
my thoughts exactly
is that my robe
oh whoopsie
here you go
nice to meet you  sir
enjoy your s'mores
bye
yeah  if mommy's gonna be single
you're gonna be single too
hey  honey  still looking for the love of your life
yeah  and i can't find him anywhere
mom  what if i only had one chance
and i blew it
i've been feeling exactly the same way
what
because dad and i aren't actually married
and he didn't want to marry me again
i know i'm putting up a brave front
but i'm really hurting
oh  maybe that's him
hey  what's up  how's it going
listen  if a big scary guy
with a beard shows up
i'm not here
  i room service   i   yeah  come on in
honey  food's here
 wow   what
aren't you a little young to be working
i got myself into some trouble
did you know that room service is extra
 everyone knows that   not everyone  my friend
great great  do you mind setting it up over there
and if you could toss the salad  that would be great
my wife will be right out  okay
uh  sure
ech
 what did you do   i tossed the salad
no  you've made a mess  get out of here
i have to open the cider
ow  my eye
i'm gonna go get you a washcloth  okay
if you need anything else  my name is marvin
i assure you  sir
when we find this person  they'll be dealt with severely
impersonating a bellman is a serious offense
well  time to go skiing
 whoa   hi
i    it's so weird running into you
i haven't been looking for you
okay  i see you have that scared look in your eye
and you're probably gonna bolt any second
so before you do that
can we just start over
sure
hey  why don't i grab us some hot cocoa
and you find us somewhere to sit
p s     i look really great next to fires
 then i'll be right here   well  i'll be right back
 whoa   hi
hi
i'm justin
oh no  we're face to face
yeah  yeah  we are
but i already was face to face
i can't be face to face to face
wait  what
well  you were supposed to be him
but now i guess it could be you
you know what  i need to talk to my psychic
i'll be right back  sorry
teddy
spencer
i next time on  i   i "good luck charlie"     i
where are we going to find  500
this is your last chance to sign up
for the ice dancing contest
grand prize     500
we'll be lucky to finish second
 there are only two teams   so you're following me
ah
why do i have a new room
because you and i are not legally married
and since it would apparently inconvenience you
to marry me again
you'll be lodging elsewhere
she said i'd come face to face
with the love of my life on this trip
and so far i've met brandon
justin and    spencer
there's something i really need to tell you face to face
no  don't say face to face
