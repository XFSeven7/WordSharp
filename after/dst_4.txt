hi  charlie  teddy here
and ivy
so you're 11 months old now
and something really big is about to happen to you
you're about to take your very first steps
this is your biggest milestone
since your first solid poop
okay  relax  i didn't get it on video
okay  you're my best friend again
anyways  i wanted to capture your first steps on tape
but every time i put the camera on you
all i see is this
wait
wait
wait
and nothing
same thing happened with the poop
today's all burnt toast
running late and dad says
has anybody seen my left shoe
i close my eyes  take a bite
grab a ride  laugh out loud
there it is up on the roof
i've been there  i've survived
so just take my advice
hang in there  baby  things are crazy
but i know your future is bright
hang in there  baby
there is no maybe
eveything turns out all right
sure life is up and down
but trust me  it comes back all around
you're gonna love who you turn out to be
hang in there  baby
good luck charlie  s01e04  double whammy
girls  girls  come here  check it out
it's an old video of me
lots of videotaping in this family
you guys sure do like yourselves
it's from my old glory days back at south high
no way  mrs  d  you went to our school
no  you're going to my school
whoa whoa  there i am  
the school mascot
you were that big sheep thing
not a sheep  a ram
rammy the wammy
here it is  
my famous wammy wiggle
listen to the crowd  they love me
well  sure
everybody loves a dancing sheep
again
it's a ram  it has horns
it sure looks like a lot of fun  mom
you really think so
yeah yeah
do you think i'd say something like that
just to humor you
i'm so happy to hear that
because they're holding mascot tryouts this week
but  mom  you've already been wammy
why would you try out again
i'm talking about you
please tell me "you" is ivy
think about it  teddy
you would be the first ever second generation wammy
i've been dreaming about this since you were born
according to the internet  sheep can have horns
look  i don't want to put any pressure on you
it's your decision  you do not have to do this for me
  i don't     no
you'll do it for us
  hey    what are you doing
watching all my old wammy videos with teddy
teddy
you're missing all the good parts
what am i saying  they're all good parts
except for this one
remember this  bob
oh  how can i forget
the night the north high barbarian took you down
oh
i hated that guy
even for a barbarian  he was a jerk
you remember the time those goons from north high
grabbed you  took you on a little joyride
every wammy's worst nightmare
you know what  i can't even watch it
it's too painful even now
oh  wait  this is a good part
come here  kids  you're gonna love this
recognize that guy
is that pj
nope  that's me
you mean that thin guy with a full head of hair is you
yep
so that means
i'm gonna look like you when i get old
oh  i stopped looking like that when i was 25
but that's only eight years from now
enjoy it while you got it
if i were you  i'd marry young
what are you doing in here
not being out there  what tape is she up to
volume three  "wammy behind the mask "
dad  she wants me to try out
oh  boy  i knew this day was coming
but i don't want to be a mascot
i'll be the biggest dork in school  you gotta help me out here
  what do you want me to do    can't you talk to her
yeah  okay
i'll do that  honey  right after i mention
that her favorite pants make her look fat
  who looks fat    my mother
hey  we almost ended at the same time
only because i dropped one of my sticks
did you see charlie
she was totally rocking out
  is she amazing or what    she's okay
okay  what is that supposed to mean
you guys are always going on and on
about what a super baby charlie is
man  i got a nephew mason  now that's a baby
what's so great about mason
well  for one thing he's a stud at peek a boo
come on  charlie can play peek a boo with her eyes closed
that's how you play peek a boo
what else you got
well  mason's an incredibly fast crawler
not as fast as charlie  she's like a cat
mason sleeps at night with a rabbit  
not a stuffed one  one that he caught
so you think mason's faster
i think charlie's faster
there's only one way to settle this
we challenge you to a baby race
oh  it is on
and you're gonna be sorry
because mason rhymes with racin'
we'll take our chances
in the meantime  you might want to take a good look at this
because that's all you and mason are gonna be seeing
i can't believe you're trying out for wammy
the whole idea behind this friendship
was for you to make me more popular
not less popular
okay  relax  i said i had to try out
i didn't say i had to do well
all right  people  time for wammy tryouts
  first up  teddy duncan    i'm teddy
daughter of amy duncan
the second finest wammy this school has ever seen
  who was the first    you're looking at her
let's do this thing
all right  duncan  let me set the scene for you
the team is down by eight
you need to get that crowd jazzed up
now give me what you got
come on  crowd  jazz up
i am not feeling that
moving on  how's your dancing
you tell me
what was that
that was interpretive dancing
that piece was called "spring day "
i can also show you "global warming"
or "dogs wow "
dancing   question mark
question mark
that stuck  exclamation point
all right  duncan  one more thing
take that flag there and fire up that crowd
there's something wrong with that flag
duncan  that was absolutely terrible  all of it
it's okay  i know what you're gonna say
congratulations  wammy
but i was awful
yeah  but you're the only one who tried out
see you at the big game
i can't believe this
well  in hindsight
i guess we should have noticed
that nobody else was here
hey  gabe  do me a favor
check the back of my head
does it look like i'm going bald
well  it's tempting to say yes
so yes
seriously
no
your hair is as full and stupid looking as ever
thank you
you're a good brother
is this why you wanted me to come down here
no  it is time to train charlie for the baby race
charlie
i thought the baby race was gonna be
you and emmett in diapers
now i've lost interest
okay  turbo baby
let's see what you've got
looks like i've got a little work to do
there she is
hi  mom
hi  wammy
oh  did miss covington call you
no  it's on the school website
already  there's not a picture up of me  is there
there is now
i just sent one in
and i've got a big surprise for you
i kept it at the end of my last season
it's been sitting in the back of the shed for the last 20 years
then i can't wait to put it on my head
come on
get it on there  girl  we've got some work to do
teddy  you look so beautiful
smells like armpit in here
i know  you'll get used to it
okay  i'm gonna teach you some of my signature wammy moves
you gotta hit it hard  girl
now you gotta keep in rhythm
and the best way to do that is with the wammy wiggle
a five  six  seven  eight
now we're gonna build on that move  you ready
we're gonna get our steam up  it goes like this
whoo  ah whoo  ah whoo
no no  sweetheart  you lost your wiggle
if you try to get your steam up without the wiggle
you'll just look like a fool out there
sure wouldn't want that to happen
next i want you to jump up in the air
and you gotta land with your arms forming a big "w"
that's really cute
no no no  teddy  it's all in the elbows
you're not vammy  you're not hammy
you're wammy
okay  girl  you do it
now dig deep and let your fire fly
i can't do this
sure you can  you just gotta practice
wammy wasn't built in a day
no  i don't want to do this
what
i don't want to be hammy or vammy or wammy
i quit
hey  what did you do to your mother
i told her i didn' want to be a wammy
i was just being honest with her
honest  what are you thinking
how's she taking it
not well
she's lying in bed with her wammy head on
stuffing tissues up her snout
i don't know
maybe being wammy was cool when you guys were in school
are you kidding me  it was never cool
your mom just didn't know that
how could she not know that
did she spend all four years of high school wearing that giant head
it was her yearbook picture
look  teddy  if you don't go to that big game
there's gonna be no wammy
and that is gonna break your mother's heart
dad  i just don't want to look stupid
look  you're gonna let your mom and everybody at school down
because you're afraid of looking stupid
yes  thank you for understanding
honey  i'm not gonna tell you what to do
but just remember
sometimes the right decision
can feel like the wrong decision
and the hard decision can be the best decision
but the good decision
oh  come on  please just be wammy
hey  wammy  going somewhere
ever been to north high  'cause i was thinking
we could all take a little trip
it's about to charge  get it
oh  this is the greatest prank ever
all right  let's see what nerd is wearing the costume this year
dude  wammy's old
wammy is not old  wammy had four kids
i didn't see her  your mom's not in there
i can't believe it
she's the only reason i'm doing this stupid thing
well  let's get out of here
duncan  the gym's this way
let me look at you
not you    wammy  put on the head
oh  you look so much like your mother
showtime
i'm right behind you  t  got your back
gentlemen  start your babies
go
and they're off
oh  look  mason  yummy yummy
come to the peaches
come to mommy  come to mommy
mason got the early lead  charlie's bringing up the rear
look at my boy go  he's barely breaking a sweat
at the halfway mark it's mason  followed by charlie
come on  charlie  you can do it
coming down the home stretch  it's still mason in the lead
come on  charlie  it's now or never
and the winner is
charlie
oh my gosh  charlie  you just took your first steps
not your best day  mason
what went wrong out there
we'll be back when we learn how to walk
can you please take me back to the gym
no way  not till the game's over
okay  can you take me home then
i don't even care about the game  guys
north high  south high    what's the difference
only one thing
  north high rules    yeah
yeah  baby
okay  whatever
look  if we're gonna drive around in circles for hours
  can i at least use the bathroom    can't you hold it
i've had four kids  i pee when i sneeze
gross
pull over
thank you  you're such a gentleman
south high rules
safety first
ram on the lam
staring at my baldness
ain't gonna stop your baldness
i just can't believe that's gonna happen to me
would you stop focusing on the negatives
  think about the positives    like what
you're gonna have a large baseball cap collection
you're gonna save on shampoo
and with the money you save on shampoo
you can buy more baseball caps
here comes teddy
that's my best friend
wammy's my best friend
