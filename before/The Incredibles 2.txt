00:00:51,794 --> 00:00:54,394
File 82-712.

3
00:00:54,396 --> 00:00:56,563
Agent Rick Dicker
interrogating.

4
00:00:56,565 --> 00:00:57,934
State your name, please.

5
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,940
Uh, Tony. Tony Rydinger.

6
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:08,575
Tell me about the incident.

7
00:01:08,577 --> 00:01:11,812
Well, there's this girl,
um, in my class.

8
00:01:11,814 --> 00:01:13,446
<i>I saw her at the track meet.</i>

9
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:16,083
- You're, uh, Violet, right?
- That's me.

10
00:01:16,085 --> 00:01:18,118
<i>I sort of knew her,
but she'd changed.</i>

11
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,453
<i>Relaxed.
She was more sure of herself.</i>

12
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:21,721
<i>Cool, cute.</i>

13
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:23,057
<i>I asked her out to a movie.</i>

14
00:01:23,059 --> 00:01:24,124
So, Friday?

15
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:25,725
- Friday.
- Friday.

16
00:01:25,727 --> 00:01:27,094
<i>And I went to watch
the track meet.</i>

17
00:01:27,096 --> 00:01:30,898
<i>Not long after, this thing
happened in the parking lot.</i>

18
00:01:45,614 --> 00:01:47,815
Behold! The Underminer!

19
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:52,652
I am always beneath you,
but nothing is beneath me!

20
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,487
<i>As if things aren't
weird enough,</i>

21
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,023
<i>I look over
and I see these boots.</i>

22
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:57,590
You two, stay here.

23
00:01:57,592 --> 00:01:59,059
Wait.
Should we be doing this?

24
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:00,627
It is still illegal.

25
00:02:00,629 --> 00:02:01,896
<i>They looked
like superheroes.</i>

26
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:03,663
- We're gonna lose him.
- Oh, all right.

27
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,865
One of you patrol
the perimeter,

28
00:02:04,867 --> 00:02:06,133
keep the crowds
back and safe.

29
00:02:06,135 --> 00:02:07,700
The other,
watch after Jack-Jack.

30
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:08,601
But I thought we were
gonna go with...

31
00:02:08,603 --> 00:02:09,636
You heard your mother.

32
00:02:09,638 --> 00:02:11,506
Trampoline me.

33
00:02:16,245 --> 00:02:17,644
I call perimeter!

34
00:02:17,646 --> 00:02:18,745
You're not
going anywhere,

35
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:20,180
you little
maggoty creep!

36
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,016
<i>I see my chance
to get out of there.</i>

37
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:25,551
<i>But there's something familiar
about one of the kids' voices.</i>

38
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:27,087
<i>The girl, she's upset</i>

39
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:28,956
<i>and she throws down
her mask...</i>

40
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:30,523
<i>and it's her!</i>

41
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,992
Oh. Tony!

42
00:02:31,994 --> 00:02:32,993
Hi.

43
00:02:32,995 --> 00:02:34,929
Uh, this isn't
what you think it is.

44
00:02:34,931 --> 00:02:36,663
<i>It was just getting
too freaky.</i>

45
00:02:36,665 --> 00:02:38,698
<i>I couldn't handle it
and ran off.</i>

46
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,100
I feel kinda bad about it.

47
00:02:40,102 --> 00:02:42,970
Maybe I should've said
"hi" or something?

48
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:45,072
It's not her fault
superheroes are illegal.

49
00:02:45,074 --> 00:02:47,074
And it's not like
I don't like strong girls.

50
00:02:47,076 --> 00:02:49,642
I'm pretty secure
manhood-wise.

51
00:02:49,644 --> 00:02:50,978
What is that?

52
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,713
Have you told anyone else
about this? Your parents?

53
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,682
No, they'd only think
I was hiding something.

54
00:02:55,684 --> 00:02:57,952
- You know what I mean?
- Sure, kid.

55
00:02:57,954 --> 00:02:59,686
I like this girl, Mr. Dicker.

56
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:01,688
I'm supposed to go out
with her Friday night.

57
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:05,092
Now, things are just
gonna be weird.

58
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:07,760
I wish I could forget
I ever saw her in that suit.

59
00:03:07,762 --> 00:03:09,165
You will, kid.

60
00:03:09,966 --> 00:03:11,801
You will.

61
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,712
Come on!

62
00:03:43,698 --> 00:03:47,301
Consider yourself undermined!

63
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,984
Ooh.

64
00:04:10,926 --> 00:04:13,293
- Underminer!
- We meet again... Huh?

65
00:04:18,034 --> 00:04:21,170
Oh, great!
Now, he's on the agenda.

66
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,252
Incredible!

67
00:04:38,254 --> 00:04:39,752
Meet Jack Hammer!

68
00:04:49,365 --> 00:04:51,133
Buh-bye!

69
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:09,383
No, no, no! No, no, no!

70
00:05:13,923 --> 00:05:17,193
Everybody, stay back!
Okay? Stay back!

71
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:21,797
You're not sticking me
with babysitting!

72
00:05:25,434 --> 00:05:29,669
I can't steer it or stop it.
And the Underminer's escaped!

73
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:31,773
We'll have to stop it...
Bob! The monorail!

74
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,850
Frozone! Yeah!

75
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:46,752
We have to stop
this thing

76
00:05:46,754 --> 00:05:47,988
before it gets
to the overpass!

77
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:50,324
I'll try to keep it away
from the buildings!

78
00:06:00,402 --> 00:06:02,138
Hey, lady!

79
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,472
Thank you so much,
young man!

80
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:12,948
What?

81
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,749
Violet!

82
00:06:17,453 --> 00:06:19,822
Ahh!

83
00:06:28,464 --> 00:06:30,464
Stop!

84
00:06:30,466 --> 00:06:32,368
Everybody, stop!

85
00:07:01,931 --> 00:07:03,933
- Heads up, Dad!
- Dash!

86
00:07:06,001 --> 00:07:08,768
Violet!
Who's watching Jack-Jack?

87
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,270
Dash is watching him!

88
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:11,807
Violet, here, you take him!

89
00:07:21,784 --> 00:07:23,116
It's headed for City Hall!

90
00:07:23,118 --> 00:07:26,155
Mom needs help!

91
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,060
They're out in public again!
This is our chance!

92
00:07:33,062 --> 00:07:35,231
Follow them,
follow Frozone!

93
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:52,114
Bob! Help me
with the boiler!

94
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:10,097
That should do it!

95
00:08:10,099 --> 00:08:12,099
What are you kids doing?
Get out of here!

96
00:08:12,101 --> 00:08:13,500
This thing's gonna blow!

97
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:15,204
There's no time!

98
00:08:27,016 --> 00:08:29,016
We did it!

99
00:08:29,018 --> 00:08:30,450
Freeze, Supers!

100
00:08:30,452 --> 00:08:33,022
Oh, what did we do?

101
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:39,428
Excuse me, Mr. Zone?

102
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,498
Sorry, but I'm not
really supposed to be here.

103
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,400
Which seems wrong...

104
00:08:46,402 --> 00:08:47,501
doesn't it?

105
00:08:47,503 --> 00:08:51,340
Perhaps you'd be interested
in changing that law?

106
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,474
<i>Superheroes including Frozone,</i>

107
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:56,343
<i>Mr. Incredible,
and Elastigirl...</i>

108
00:08:56,345 --> 00:08:58,512
<i>caused further damage
to the city.</i>

109
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:01,014
<i>The Underminer
remains at large.</i>

110
00:09:01,016 --> 00:09:02,883
We didn't start
this fight.

111
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:04,284
Well, you didn't
finish it either!

112
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:06,420
Did you stop the Underminer
from inflicting more damage?

113
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:07,354
No.

114
00:09:07,356 --> 00:09:08,989
Did you stop him
from robbing the banks?

115
00:09:08,991 --> 00:09:10,457
- No.
- Did you catch him?

116
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:12,959
- No.
- The banks were insured.

117
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,227
We have infrastructure
in place

118
00:09:14,229 --> 00:09:15,462
to deal
with these matters.

119
00:09:15,464 --> 00:09:17,264
If you had simply
done nothing...

120
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,932
everything would now be

121
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,233
proceeding
in an orderly fashion.

122
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:22,669
You'd have preferred
we do nothing?

123
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,373
Without a doubt.

124
00:09:28,544 --> 00:09:30,077
You weren't much help.

125
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:32,112
Do you want
out of the hole?

126
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:35,284
First you gotta
put down the shovel.

127
00:09:38,053 --> 00:09:40,222
Well, that went poorly.

128
00:09:40,956 --> 00:09:43,090
Dad, this is probably

129
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:46,360
not the best time
to tell you about this...

130
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:49,431
but something else
happened today with a kid...

131
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,334
and my mask.

132
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,147
Oh, hey, Rick.

133
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:09,516
Violet thinks a friend
of hers, a kid named Tony...

134
00:10:09,518 --> 00:10:12,486
might have seen her in the
outfit, without her mask.

135
00:10:12,488 --> 00:10:14,654
- Talkative type?
- Don't know.

136
00:10:14,656 --> 00:10:16,123
Last name is Rydinger.

137
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,458
Tony Rydinger.

138
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,127
I'll check it out.

139
00:10:20,129 --> 00:10:21,628
Bob, Helen...

140
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,264
a word
if you don't mind.

141
00:10:24,266 --> 00:10:27,267
Uh, the program's been
shut down.

142
00:10:27,269 --> 00:10:28,702
What?

143
00:10:28,704 --> 00:10:30,404
Politicians don't
understand people...

144
00:10:30,406 --> 00:10:33,740
who do good simply
because it's right.

145
00:10:33,742 --> 00:10:35,442
It makes 'em nervous.

146
00:10:35,444 --> 00:10:38,278
They've been gunning
for Supers for years.

147
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,680
Today was all they needed.

148
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:42,582
Anyway...

149
00:10:42,584 --> 00:10:44,151
I'm done.

150
00:10:44,153 --> 00:10:46,119
I'm afraid two more
weeks in the motel

151
00:10:46,121 --> 00:10:47,554
is the best
I can do for ya.

152
00:10:47,556 --> 00:10:48,688
It ain't much.

153
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,023
You've done plenty, Rick.

154
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,525
We won't forget.

155
00:10:51,527 --> 00:10:53,760
Well, it has been
a great honor

156
00:10:53,762 --> 00:10:55,295
working with
you good people.

157
00:10:55,297 --> 00:10:57,764
Thanks for everything,
and good luck.

158
00:10:57,766 --> 00:11:00,302
Yeah. You, too.

159
00:11:14,516 --> 00:11:16,385
Did you wash your hands?

160
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,255
With soap?

161
00:11:21,657 --> 00:11:23,625
Did you dry them?

162
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:32,165
What? Is this all vegetables?
Who ordered all vegetables?

163
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,334
I did. They're good and
you're going to have some.

164
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:38,205
Are we going to
talk about it?

165
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:40,440
- What?
- The elephant in the room.

166
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:43,076
- What elephant?
- I guess not then.

167
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,277
You're referring
to today.

168
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,079
Yeah, what's the deal
with today?

169
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,481
We all made mistakes.

170
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:48,448
For example,

171
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,484
you kids were supposed
to watch Jack-Jack.

172
00:11:50,486 --> 00:11:53,720
Babysitting, while you guys
did the important stuff.

173
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:55,489
We talked about this.

174
00:11:55,491 --> 00:11:56,756
You're not old enough to
decide about these things.

175
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,124
We are old enough
to help out.

176
00:11:58,126 --> 00:11:59,226
Yeah!

177
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:00,828
Isn't that what
you tell us, Dad?

178
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:04,264
Yeah, well, "help out" can
mean many different things.

179
00:12:04,266 --> 00:12:06,066
But we're supposed to help,
if there's trouble.

180
00:12:06,068 --> 00:12:07,434
- Well, yeah, but...
- Aren't you

181
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,135
- glad we helped today?
- Yeah, I know but...

182
00:12:09,137 --> 00:12:10,237
You said that you were
proud of us.

183
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:12,138
Well, yeah, I was. Am!

184
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,507
We wanna fight
bad guys!

185
00:12:13,509 --> 00:12:16,543
No, you don't!

186
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:18,578
You said things
were different now.

187
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,147
And they were,
on the island.

188
00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:22,749
But I didn't mean
that from now on...

189
00:12:22,751 --> 00:12:25,519
So now, we've gotta go back
to never using our powers.

190
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:26,821
It defines who I am.

191
00:12:26,823 --> 00:12:28,488
We're not saying
you have...

192
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,657
- What?
- Someone on TV said it.

193
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:32,259
Can we just eat?

194
00:12:32,261 --> 00:12:35,128
The dinner, while it's hot?

195
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,696
Did we do
something wrong?

196
00:12:36,698 --> 00:12:38,198
- Yes.
- No.

197
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,467
We didn't do
anything wrong.

198
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,702
Superheroes are illegal.

199
00:12:42,704 --> 00:12:44,671
Whether it's fair or not,
that's the law.

200
00:12:44,673 --> 00:12:47,808
The law should be fair. What
are we teaching our kids?

201
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:49,142
To respect the law!

202
00:12:49,144 --> 00:12:50,544
Even when the law
is disrespectful?

203
00:12:50,546 --> 00:12:53,380
If laws are unjust, there
are laws to change them!

204
00:12:53,382 --> 00:12:54,548
Otherwise, it's chaos!

205
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,652
Which is exactly
what we have!

206
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:04,658
I just thought
it was kinda cool.

207
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:08,695
- What was?
- Fighting crime as a family.

208
00:13:08,697 --> 00:13:11,832
It was cool.

209
00:13:11,834 --> 00:13:14,869
But it's over.
The world is what it is.

210
00:13:14,871 --> 00:13:17,170
We have to adapt.

211
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:18,839
Are things bad?

212
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,475
Things are fine.

213
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,779
May I be excused?

214
00:13:26,916 --> 00:13:29,917
How much longer
in the motel, Dad?

215
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:32,754
- Uh...
- Not much longer, honey.

216
00:13:40,162 --> 00:13:41,261
What are we
gonna do?

217
00:13:41,263 --> 00:13:43,163
I don't know.

218
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:44,664
Maybe Dicker
will find something?

219
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,800
Dicker is done, Bob.

220
00:13:45,802 --> 00:13:49,336
Any thought we had about being
Supers again is fantasy.

221
00:13:49,338 --> 00:13:50,938
One of us
has gotta get a job.

222
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,339
One of us?

223
00:13:52,341 --> 00:13:54,407
You did a long stint
at Insuricare.

224
00:13:54,409 --> 00:13:56,242
Hated every minute of it.

225
00:13:56,244 --> 00:13:57,778
I know
it was hard on you.

226
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:59,613
Maybe it's my turn
in the private sector

227
00:13:59,615 --> 00:14:01,247
and you take care
of the kids...

228
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:04,751
No, I'm doing this.
I need to do this.

229
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,887
You know where my suit
and ties are?

230
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:08,321
Burned up when...

231
00:14:08,323 --> 00:14:10,256
The jet destroyed
our house.

232
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:11,625
Yeah.

233
00:14:11,627 --> 00:14:14,361
We can't count
on anyone else now, Bob.

234
00:14:14,363 --> 00:14:15,629
It's just us.

235
00:14:15,631 --> 00:14:16,799
We can't wait for...

236
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,842
No lifeguard on duty!

237
00:14:27,844 --> 00:14:29,442
Swim at your own risk.

238
00:14:29,444 --> 00:14:30,778
Oh, where'd you go today?

239
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,947
I noticed
you missed all the fun.

240
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:35,783
Don't be mad because
I know when to leave a party.

241
00:14:35,785 --> 00:14:37,484
I'm just as illegal
as you guys.

242
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:40,286
Besides, I knew the cops
would let you go.

243
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:41,889
Yeah, in spite
of Bob's best efforts.

244
00:14:41,891 --> 00:14:43,523
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

245
00:14:43,525 --> 00:14:46,393
I heard
the program shut down.

246
00:14:46,395 --> 00:14:48,294
How much longer
are you in this motel?

247
00:14:48,296 --> 00:14:49,562
Two weeks.

248
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:51,364
Now, you know
the offer still stands.

249
00:14:51,366 --> 00:14:53,600
You're very generous,
but there are five of us.

250
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:55,402
We wouldn't do that
to you and Honey.

251
00:14:55,404 --> 00:14:56,804
Well, door's always open.

252
00:14:56,806 --> 00:14:59,372
You know,
the news isn't all bad.

253
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:01,909
While you guys
were being detained...

254
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:05,745
I was approached by a dude
who represents this tycoon.

255
00:15:05,747 --> 00:15:07,815
- Winston Deavor.
- Wants to talk...

256
00:15:07,817 --> 00:15:11,551
with me, with you two,
about hero stuff.

257
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:12,787
I checked him out.

258
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:13,720
He's legit.

259
00:15:13,722 --> 00:15:15,588
Trained under Dicker.
He wants to meet.

260
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,724
Ah, jeez!
More superhero trouble.

261
00:15:17,726 --> 00:15:19,759
We just came from
the police station, Lucius.

262
00:15:19,761 --> 00:15:23,630
- When?
- Tonight. I'm going there now.

263
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,498
You enjoy,
I'm sitting this one out.

264
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,934
He wants
all three of us.

265
00:15:26,936 --> 00:15:30,704
Honey, let's just at least
hear what he has to say.

266
00:15:30,706 --> 00:15:33,473
You got the address,
I'll meet you guys there.

267
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,742
Go in our Supersuits?

268
00:15:35,744 --> 00:15:37,377
Yeah.

269
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:39,646
Might wanna wear
the old Supersuits.

270
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,718
Got a feeling
he's nostalgic.

271
00:15:46,288 --> 00:15:47,988
Where are you going?

272
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,657
The fresh air
is especially good tonight.

273
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:51,926
If Jack-Jack
wakes up...

274
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:53,662
I know the drill.

275
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:06,874
Your security badges.
Please, this way.

276
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:08,541
Hey, listen,
you're my biggest fan.

277
00:16:08,543 --> 00:16:09,642
Good to see you.

278
00:16:09,644 --> 00:16:12,614
I'm your biggest fan.
Shoot!

279
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:39,339
I love superheroes!

280
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,508
The powers, the costumes...

281
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,343
the mythic struggles.

282
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:45,445
Winston Deavor.
You can call me Win.

283
00:16:45,447 --> 00:16:46,713
Genuine pleasure
to meet you.

284
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:48,515
- Frozone!
- It's good to see you.

285
00:16:48,517 --> 00:16:49,850
- Elastigirl.
- Nice to meet you.

286
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:52,019
- Mr. Incredible!
- Hello.

287
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:54,789
<i>♪ Mr. Incredible,

288
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,623

Yeah!

295
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,910
Can't tell you what a thrill this is.
And this...

296
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:20,047
Oh, hello there, superheroes.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

297
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:21,949
...is my tardy sister,
Evelyn.

298
00:17:21,951 --> 00:17:25,886
And I'm scolding myself so
you don't have to, Winston!

299
00:17:25,888 --> 00:17:27,420
Spectacular.

300
00:17:27,422 --> 00:17:29,489
My father was so proud

301
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:32,625
that I was even remotely
connected to you guys.

302
00:17:32,627 --> 00:17:34,829
He used to call you
the last line of defense.

303
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:36,797
He was
your top supporter.

304
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,432
He donated
to superhero causes.

305
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:40,700
<i>He raised money</i>

306
00:17:40,702 --> 00:17:42,602
<i>for the Dynaguy statue
in Avery Park.</i>

307
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,604
<i>He got to know
many Supers personally.</i>

308
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,106
<i>Even installed a phone</i>

309
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:49,475
<i>with direct lines
to Gazerbeam and Fironic...</i>

310
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:50,878
<i>in case of emergencies.</i>

311
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,613
<i>He loved that,
showed it off to everyone.</i>

312
00:17:53,615 --> 00:17:54,849
He was heartbroken

313
00:17:54,851 --> 00:17:56,583
when you were all forced
to go underground.

314
00:17:56,585 --> 00:17:57,985
Father believed
the world

315
00:17:57,987 --> 00:17:59,989
would become more dangerous
without you.

316
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,592
He didn't know
how right he was.

317
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,926
<i>There was a break-in.</i>

318
00:18:07,729 --> 00:18:10,097
<i>My father called Gazerbeam.</i>

319
00:18:10,099 --> 00:18:11,731
<i>The direct line.</i>

320
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:13,466
<i>No answer.</i>

321
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:16,136
<i>He called Fironic, no answer.</i>

322
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:19,439
<i>Superheroes had just been
made illegal...</i>

323
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:21,641
<i>The robbers discovered him
on the phone...</i>

324
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:23,012
<i>and shot him.</i>

325
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:26,914
So...

326
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:28,182
It must've been hard.

327
00:18:28,184 --> 00:18:29,783
Especially for Mother.

328
00:18:29,785 --> 00:18:32,953
She died a few months later.
Heartbreak.

329
00:18:32,955 --> 00:18:35,823
If superheroes had not been
forced underground...

330
00:18:35,825 --> 00:18:37,091
it never would've happened.

331
00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:39,692
Or Dad could've taken
Mom to the safe room

332
00:18:39,694 --> 00:18:41,028
as soon as he knew
there was trouble.

333
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,562
I disagree strongly!

334
00:18:42,564 --> 00:18:44,699
But we're not going
into it right now.

335
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,699
The point is...

336
00:18:46,701 --> 00:18:48,601
nobody expected us

337
00:18:48,603 --> 00:18:51,038
to be able to actually
run Dad's company.

338
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,775
But with Evelyn as designer,
and myself as operator...

339
00:18:54,777 --> 00:18:57,244
uh, we threw ourselves
into building DEVTECH

340
00:18:57,246 --> 00:18:58,879
into what it is today.

341
00:18:58,881 --> 00:19:01,648
A world-class
telecommunications company.

342
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,050
Bigger than ever.

343
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:06,153
Perfectly positioned to make
some wrong things right.

344
00:19:06,155 --> 00:19:07,922
Hence, this meeting.

345
00:19:07,924 --> 00:19:09,656
Let me
ask you something.

346
00:19:09,658 --> 00:19:11,491
What is the main reason

347
00:19:11,493 --> 00:19:13,060
you were all
forced underground?

348
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:15,129
- Ignorance.
- Perception.

349
00:19:15,131 --> 00:19:17,664
Take today for example,
with the Underminer.

350
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,099
Difficult situation.

351
00:19:19,101 --> 00:19:21,501
You were faced with a
lot of hard decisions.

352
00:19:21,503 --> 00:19:22,669
Oh, tell me about it.

353
00:19:22,671 --> 00:19:23,904
I can't.

354
00:19:23,906 --> 00:19:26,572
Because I didn't see it...

355
00:19:26,574 --> 00:19:28,175
neither did anyone else.

356
00:19:28,177 --> 00:19:30,576
So, when you fight bad
guys like today...

357
00:19:30,578 --> 00:19:33,213
people don't see the fight
or what led up to it.

358
00:19:33,215 --> 00:19:35,816
They see what politicians
tell them to see.

359
00:19:35,818 --> 00:19:38,718
They see destruction
and they see you.

360
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,120
So, if we wanna change

361
00:19:40,122 --> 00:19:42,923
people's perceptions
about superheroes...

362
00:19:42,925 --> 00:19:43,891
we need you

363
00:19:43,893 --> 00:19:46,260
to share your perceptions
with the world.

364
00:19:46,262 --> 00:19:48,561
- How do we do that?
- With cameras.

365
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:52,699
<i>We need you to share your
perceptions with the world.</i>

366
00:19:52,701 --> 00:19:53,934
<i>How do we do that?</i>

367
00:19:53,936 --> 00:19:56,136
We embed
tiny cameras, like those,

368
00:19:56,138 --> 00:19:57,570
into your Supersuits.

369
00:19:57,572 --> 00:19:58,771
Wow, so small.

370
00:19:58,773 --> 00:20:00,274
And the picture
is outstanding.

371
00:20:00,276 --> 00:20:02,042
Thanks!
Designed 'em myself.

372
00:20:02,044 --> 00:20:03,643
We've got
resources, lobbyists,

373
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:04,979
worldwide connections...

374
00:20:04,981 --> 00:20:07,547
and very important,
insurance.

375
00:20:07,549 --> 00:20:08,849
Insurance is key.

376
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:11,251
All we need now are the
super-est superheroes.

377
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:13,720
It needs you three.
Come on!

378
00:20:13,722 --> 00:20:17,091
Help me make all Supers
legal again.

379
00:20:17,093 --> 00:20:18,192
This sounds great!

380
00:20:18,194 --> 00:20:20,660
Let's get this going.
What's my first assignment?

381
00:20:20,662 --> 00:20:22,729
That enthusiasm is golden.

382
00:20:22,731 --> 00:20:24,999
Now hold on to it.
But for our first move...

383
00:20:25,001 --> 00:20:28,768
Well, Elastigirl
is our best play.

384
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,606
Better than me?

385
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:33,807
I mean, she's good.

386
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:35,909
Really, a credit to her...

387
00:20:35,911 --> 00:20:38,779
You know. You know.

388
00:20:38,781 --> 00:20:40,080
With great respect...

389
00:20:40,082 --> 00:20:41,081
let's not test the whole

390
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,983
"insurance-will-pay-
for-everything" idea...

391
00:20:42,985 --> 00:20:45,185
on the first go 'round, okay?

392
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:48,889
Wait a minute. You're saying what?
I'm messy?

393
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:50,924
Well, Evelyn did
a cost-benefit analysis...

394
00:20:50,926 --> 00:20:53,293
comparing all your last
five years of crime fighting

395
00:20:53,295 --> 00:20:54,995
before going underground.

396
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:56,997
And Elastigirl's numbers
are self-explanatory.

397
00:20:56,999 --> 00:20:59,033
Well, it's not
a fair comparison!

398
00:20:59,035 --> 00:21:01,869
Heavyweight problems
need heavyweight solutions.

399
00:21:01,871 --> 00:21:03,636
Of course!
We're gonna solve

400
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,705
all kinds
of problems together.

401
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:10,112
After the perfect launch
with Elastigirl!

402
00:21:10,846 --> 00:21:13,280
So, what do you say?

403
00:21:13,282 --> 00:21:15,851
What do I say?

404
00:21:16,651 --> 00:21:18,852
I don't know.

405
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:20,620
What do you mean,
you don't know?

406
00:21:20,622 --> 00:21:22,956
A few hours ago, you were
saying it was over...

407
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:25,159
and being a superhero
was a fantasy.

408
00:21:25,161 --> 00:21:27,261
Now, you get the offer
of a lifetime

409
00:21:27,263 --> 00:21:28,929
and you don't know?

410
00:21:28,931 --> 00:21:32,099
It's not that simple, Bob.
I wanna protect the kids!

411
00:21:32,101 --> 00:21:33,666
So do I.

412
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,202
From jail, Bob!

413
00:21:35,204 --> 00:21:36,769
And how do you do that?

414
00:21:36,771 --> 00:21:38,939
By turning down a chance
to change the law

415
00:21:38,941 --> 00:21:40,340
that forces them to hide
what they are?

416
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,976
They haven't decided what they are.
They're still kids.

417
00:21:42,978 --> 00:21:45,312
Kids with powers,
which makes them Supers...

418
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:47,948
whether they decide to
use those powers or not.

419
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:49,316
This will benefit them.

420
00:21:49,318 --> 00:21:51,118
It's not a good time
to be away.

421
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,886
Dash is having trouble
with homework...

422
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:54,788
Vi is worried
about her first date

423
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,223
with that boy she likes,
Tony...

424
00:21:56,225 --> 00:21:57,024
and Jack-Jack...

425
00:21:57,026 --> 00:21:59,993
Jack-Jack?
What's wrong with him?

426
00:21:59,995 --> 00:22:01,295
Okay, nothing's wrong
with Jack-Jack.

427
00:22:01,297 --> 00:22:04,064
But even a normal baby
needs a lot of attention.

428
00:22:04,066 --> 00:22:05,899
I'm just not sure
I can leave.

429
00:22:05,901 --> 00:22:07,334
Of course you can leave.

430
00:22:07,336 --> 00:22:09,436
You've got to.
So that I...

431
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:11,371
we can be Supers again,

432
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:13,173
so our kids can have
that choice.

433
00:22:13,175 --> 00:22:15,242
So you can have
that choice.

434
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:16,443
All right, yes!

435
00:22:16,445 --> 00:22:19,012
So I can have
that choice.

436
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:21,348
And I would do a great job!

437
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:26,120
Regardless of what Deavor's
pie charts say or whatever...

438
00:22:26,122 --> 00:22:28,088
But they want you.

439
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,960
And you'll do a great...

440
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:33,062
job...

441
00:22:33,429 --> 00:22:36,230
too.

442
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:39,266
Well, that
was excruciating to watch.

443
00:22:39,268 --> 00:22:41,301
I can't lie to you.

444
00:22:41,303 --> 00:22:44,770
It's nice to be wanted.
Flattering, you know, but...

445
00:22:44,772 --> 00:22:45,839
But what's the choice?

446
00:22:45,841 --> 00:22:47,141
One, do this right,

447
00:22:47,143 --> 00:22:48,741
get well paid,
we're out of the motel...

448
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:50,344
and things get better
for all Supers,

449
00:22:50,346 --> 00:22:51,744
including our kids.

450
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,213
Or two...

451
00:22:53,215 --> 00:22:56,749
I find a job in two weeks
or we're homeless.

452
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,218
You know
it's crazy, right?

453
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:00,753
To help my family,
I gotta leave it.

454
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:01,855
To fix the law,
I gotta break it.

455
00:23:01,857 --> 00:23:02,956
You'll be great.

456
00:23:02,958 --> 00:23:04,124
I know I will.

457
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:05,192
But what about you?
We have kids.

458
00:23:05,194 --> 00:23:06,994
I'll watch the kids,
no problem.

459
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:08,761
- Easy.
- Easy, huh?

460
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,230
You're adorable.

461
00:23:10,232 --> 00:23:11,764
Well, if there is
a problem,

462
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:12,900
I'll drop this thing
and come right back.

463
00:23:12,902 --> 00:23:14,134
You won't need to.

464
00:23:14,136 --> 00:23:16,305
I got it,
you go do this thing.

465
00:23:17,106 --> 00:23:19,039
Do it so...

466
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,741
I can do it better.

467
00:23:21,743 --> 00:23:23,911
Deavor here.

468
00:23:23,913 --> 00:23:25,345
This is Elastigirl.

469
00:23:25,347 --> 00:23:26,382
I'm in.

470
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:32,486
Mr. Deavor,
it's wonderful...

471
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:34,087
<i>but it's too generous.</i>

472
00:23:34,089 --> 00:23:35,522
Nonsense! That's the
least we can do.

473
00:23:35,524 --> 00:23:37,057
We're partners now!

474
00:23:37,059 --> 00:23:39,026
Can't have my partners
living in a motel.

475
00:23:39,028 --> 00:23:41,395
But whose house?
Is it a house?

476
00:23:41,397 --> 00:23:43,297
<i>It's my house.
I have several.</i>

477
00:23:43,299 --> 00:23:45,866
<i>I'm not using that one.
Stay as long as you need.</i>

478
00:23:45,868 --> 00:23:47,434
I don't know
what to say.

479
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:49,805
How about "thanks"?

480
00:23:50,472 --> 00:23:52,372
This is our new house?

481
00:23:52,374 --> 00:23:55,876
Okay, easy, tiger.
It's being loaned to us.

482
00:23:55,878 --> 00:23:57,945
This is homey.

483
00:23:57,947 --> 00:23:59,279
Look at this place.

484
00:23:59,281 --> 00:24:01,982
Deavor bought it from
an eccentric billionaire...

485
00:24:01,984 --> 00:24:03,483
who liked to come and go
without being seen...

486
00:24:03,485 --> 00:24:06,153
so the house has
multiple hidden exits.

487
00:24:06,155 --> 00:24:07,821
Good thing
we won't stand out.

488
00:24:07,823 --> 00:24:10,958
Wouldn't want to attract
any unnecessary attention.

489
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,993
It's got
a big yard!

490
00:24:12,995 --> 00:24:15,229
Isn't this a bit much?

491
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:17,030
Near a forest!

492
00:24:17,032 --> 00:24:18,899
Would you rather be
at the motel?

493
00:24:18,901 --> 00:24:20,234
And a pool!

494
00:24:21,203 --> 00:24:23,370
What exactly
is Mom's new job?

495
00:24:23,372 --> 00:24:26,006
The important thing is
we're out of the motel.

496
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:28,377
I like Mom's new job!

497
00:24:29,445 --> 00:24:31,380
Oh, ho, ho!

498
00:24:34,383 --> 00:24:37,317
Whoa.

499
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,420
Whoa.

500
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:42,823
Well, check out
the water features.

501
00:24:44,994 --> 00:24:46,328
- Oh!
- Wow.

502
00:24:48,397 --> 00:24:50,430
Wicked cool!

503
00:24:56,005 --> 00:24:57,471
Hey! Dash! Stop it!

504
00:24:57,473 --> 00:24:59,273
- Not the couch! Stop it!
- No! Dash!

505
00:24:59,275 --> 00:25:00,874
Stop!

506
00:25:00,876 --> 00:25:02,042
- Don't touch the buttons!
- The couch!

507
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:03,210
- Dash!
- No!

508
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:05,145
No, no!

509
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:07,047
Oh, no.
Oh, boy.

510
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:09,184
This isn't me.

511
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,888
I'm not all dark
and angsty.

512
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:16,023
I'm Elastigirl.

513
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:18,025
I'm, you know,
flexible.

514
00:25:18,027 --> 00:25:19,259
E designed this?

515
00:25:19,261 --> 00:25:22,229
No, some guy named
Alexander Galbaki.

516
00:25:22,231 --> 00:25:24,364
Glad it's you and not me,

517
00:25:24,366 --> 00:25:27,100
'cause you're gonna
hear from her.

518
00:25:27,102 --> 00:25:28,502
This note came with it.

519
00:25:28,504 --> 00:25:29,505
What?

520
00:25:36,445 --> 00:25:38,445
A new Elasticycle.

521
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:41,381
Elasticycle? I didn't
know you had a bike.

522
00:25:41,383 --> 00:25:42,282
Hey, I had a mohawk.

523
00:25:42,284 --> 00:25:44,117
There's a lot about me
you don't know.

524
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:46,153
Yeah, but...
A mohawk?

525
00:25:46,155 --> 00:25:48,488
Ah, you didn't miss anything.

526
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:53,293
Oh, yeah!
This one's electric.

527
00:25:53,295 --> 00:25:56,398
- What's that mean?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

528
00:25:59,134 --> 00:26:02,102
Means it's torque-y.
I'll get the hang of it.

529
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,370
You will be great.

530
00:26:03,372 --> 00:26:05,205
I will be great.
And you will, too.

531
00:26:05,207 --> 00:26:07,007
We will both be great.

532
00:26:07,009 --> 00:26:08,243
Bye, sweetie.

533
00:26:31,066 --> 00:26:32,432
Wait a minute!

534
00:26:32,434 --> 00:26:33,967
- Is that Elastigirl?
- I think that's Elastigirl.

535
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:36,138
Hey! Elastigirl!

536
00:26:42,144 --> 00:26:44,279
Marry me, Elastigirl!

537
00:26:46,382 --> 00:26:47,714
<i>♪ Here comes Elastigirl</i>

538
00:26:47,716 --> 00:26:49,116
<i>♪ Stretching her</i>

539
00:26:49,118 --> 00:26:50,384
No theme songs

540
00:26:50,386 --> 00:26:52,521
or I'll turn this bus
right around!

541
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,524
Look at that.

542
00:26:57,526 --> 00:26:58,525
New Urbem.

543
00:26:58,527 --> 00:27:00,660
You wanna make a big
crime fighting statement...

544
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,396
you go where
the crime is big.

545
00:27:02,398 --> 00:27:04,998
Strange thing to be
excited about, Winston.

546
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,269
It's like
a superhero's playground!

547
00:27:11,073 --> 00:27:13,540
No Sugar Bombs
on my watch.

548
00:27:16,545 --> 00:27:17,644
Where's Mom?

549
00:27:17,646 --> 00:27:18,979
She's up and out.

550
00:27:18,981 --> 00:27:20,414
She's at her new job
doing hero work.

551
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:23,216
But I thought superheroes
were still illegal.

552
00:27:23,218 --> 00:27:24,651
They are, for now.

553
00:27:24,653 --> 00:27:28,021
So Mom is getting paid
to break the law?

554
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:29,256
She's not breaking...

555
00:27:29,258 --> 00:27:31,625
She's an advocate
for superheroes.

556
00:27:31,627 --> 00:27:32,759
It's a new job.

557
00:27:32,761 --> 00:27:35,562
So, Mom is going out
illegally...

558
00:27:35,564 --> 00:27:39,032
to explain why
she shouldn't be illegal.

559
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:40,734
Hey... Hey!

560
00:27:40,736 --> 00:27:42,436
The bus is here!

561
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:47,107
Whoa! Grab your stuff quickly!
Go on, get on the...

562
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:49,344
Put your homework
in your pack!

563
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:51,447
Bye-bye!

564
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:59,719
We're gonna get along
just fine...

565
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:03,323
'cause you don't ask any hard questions.

566
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:07,427
<i>All right. All locations,</i>

567
00:28:07,429 --> 00:28:08,695
<i>we need to know
where you want us.</i>

568
00:28:08,697 --> 00:28:10,063
<i>Stand by.</i>

569
00:28:10,065 --> 00:28:12,766
Seems strange
to wait for crime.

570
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:14,601
Relax.
You're smack in the middle...

571
00:28:14,603 --> 00:28:18,238
of the worst crime area
in the city. It's perfect.

572
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,639
It's a superhero's
playground.

573
00:28:19,641 --> 00:28:21,341
<i>"It's a superhero's
playground." Right.</i>

574
00:28:21,343 --> 00:28:23,043
You know,
after we went underground...

575
00:28:23,045 --> 00:28:25,078
my husband used to listen
to a police scanner...

576
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,680
waiting for something
to happen.

577
00:28:26,682 --> 00:28:28,615
And I got mad at him
for it.

578
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:31,751
Oh, I'm such a hypocrite.

579
00:28:31,753 --> 00:28:33,420
- <i>All units.</i>
- Something's up.

580
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:34,956
<i>We've been picking up
some chatter about</i>

581
00:28:34,958 --> 00:28:38,158
<i>potential disruptions to the
hovertrain's opening ceremony.</i>

582
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,460
- <i>Disruption or threat?</i>
- <i>Both.</i>

583
00:28:40,462 --> 00:28:42,095
<i>Station's at Fifty-Fourth
and Nottingham.</i>

584
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:44,197
A potential threat!
Perfect!

585
00:28:44,199 --> 00:28:46,535
Fifty-fourth and Nottingham.
Go, go, go!

586
00:28:48,237 --> 00:28:51,638
Hey, Vi! I want you
back here by 10:30.

587
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,706
11-ish?

588
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:55,108
10-ish,
heading for 9:30-ish.

589
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:57,177
10:30-ish it is.

590
00:28:57,179 --> 00:28:58,712
Enjoy the movie.

591
00:28:58,714 --> 00:29:00,815
"In the county of Noddoff...

592
00:29:00,817 --> 00:29:02,749
"the Frubbers of Freep...

593
00:29:02,751 --> 00:29:08,123
"are all giving in to
the sweet succor of sleep."

594
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:20,133
<i>We will
control the horizontal...</i>

595
00:29:20,135 --> 00:29:22,304
<i>we will control the vertical.</i>

596
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,411
That's not the way you're
supposed to do it, Dad.

597
00:29:31,413 --> 00:29:33,280
They want us
to do it this way.

598
00:29:33,282 --> 00:29:36,283
I don't know that way!
Why would they change math?

599
00:29:36,285 --> 00:29:38,518
- It's okay, Dad.
- Math is math!

600
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,620
I'll just wait for Mom
to get back.

601
00:29:40,622 --> 00:29:41,621
What?

602
00:29:41,623 --> 00:29:44,491
She won't understand it
any better than I do...

603
00:29:44,493 --> 00:29:46,161
<i>The Outer Limits.</i>

604
00:29:49,131 --> 00:29:50,530
"All over Doozle-Dorf,

605
00:29:50,532 --> 00:29:53,166
"the Fribbers of Frupp

00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:55,335
"'cause they just
can't keep up.

"Everyone,

"Everyone's getting the sleep

00:30:12,554 --> 00:30:15,755
<i>Mayors often brag

613
00:30:15,757 --> 00:30:17,557
<i>and I'm no exception.</i>

614
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:18,826
<i>And I'm willing to admit</i>

615
00:30:18,828 --> 00:30:21,194
<i>that New Urbem
is not the only city...</i>

616
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:23,463
Are you sure the police are
gonna be okay with this?

617
00:30:23,465 --> 00:30:25,465
<i>Sure. You're making
life easy for them.</i>

618
00:30:25,467 --> 00:30:26,867
They still haven't
forgiven us

619
00:30:26,869 --> 00:30:28,702
for the last time we made
life easy for them.

620
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,737
I know the Chief of Police.
There won't be a problem.

621
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:31,638
With all due respect...

622
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,274
if you alone had handled
the Underminer...

623
00:30:34,276 --> 00:30:36,276
things would have
been different.

624
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:37,644
<i>I'm just saying.</i>

625
00:30:37,646 --> 00:30:39,746
<i>...on budget
and ahead of schedule...</i>

626
00:30:39,748 --> 00:30:43,383
<i>to launch our magnificent
new hovertrain.</i>

627
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:45,886
<i>It can get you
where you need to go</i>

628
00:30:45,888 --> 00:30:47,855
<i>at ridiculous speeds.</i>

629
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:51,491
<i>The future is open
for business!</i>

630
00:31:11,446 --> 00:31:12,913
Wait. The train has stopped.

631
00:31:16,451 --> 00:31:17,686
It's going
the wrong direction.

632
00:31:19,254 --> 00:31:20,788
It's going the wrong way.

633
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:21,791
I'm going after it.

634
00:31:26,662 --> 00:31:29,295
This thing's really moving.

635
00:31:29,297 --> 00:31:31,633
100 and climbing.
How much track is built?

636
00:31:32,902 --> 00:31:34,403
<i>About 25 miles.</i>

637
00:31:41,643 --> 00:31:43,944
No one can shut
this thing down?

638
00:31:43,946 --> 00:31:45,313
<i>They've tried. No-go.</i>

639
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:48,684
Is that Elastigirl?

640
00:31:56,324 --> 00:31:57,524
Overrides?

641
00:31:57,526 --> 00:31:58,627
They're locked out
of the system.

642
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,968
- What about a fail-safe?
- <i>Not enough time.</i>

643
00:32:10,873 --> 00:32:12,840
Someone's calling!
Switching over.

644
00:32:12,842 --> 00:32:14,741
<i>Hey, Mom.
I can't find my high-tops</i>

645
00:32:14,743 --> 00:32:16,409
<i>and Dad
can't find them either.</i>

646
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:18,611
<i>But he won't call you
and ask, so I am.</i>

647
00:32:18,613 --> 00:32:20,280
<i>Do not call your mother!</i>

648
00:32:20,282 --> 00:32:21,681
Dash, honey.
Can't talk right now.

649
00:32:21,683 --> 00:32:23,583
Look under your bed, okay.
How much time?

650
00:32:23,585 --> 00:32:25,552
<i>Less than two minutes!</i>

651
00:32:25,554 --> 00:32:27,589
<i>There's a shortcut. Cut
through the culvert up ahead.</i>

652
00:32:35,697 --> 00:32:37,934
I don't know
if I can stay with it.

653
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:48,128
What the heck was that?

654
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:50,430
Is everybody all right?
Is anybody injured?

655
00:34:50,432 --> 00:34:51,700
Are you all right?

656
00:34:54,971 --> 00:34:56,738
Your story better be good.

657
00:34:58,473 --> 00:35:00,573
Hey. Hey!

658
00:35:00,575 --> 00:35:02,076
What happened?

659
00:35:35,543 --> 00:35:36,777
Honey, why are you...

660
00:35:36,779 --> 00:35:39,614
Don't say anything.

661
00:35:43,685 --> 00:35:46,053
It's Dad.
Are you okay?

662
00:35:46,055 --> 00:35:49,256
I'm fine. I don't
wanna talk about it.

663
00:35:49,258 --> 00:35:50,925
Tony didn't even call?

664
00:35:50,927 --> 00:35:52,960
I don't wanna
talk about it.

665
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:54,694
- Oh, honey...
- Dad!

666
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:58,564
If you want me to feel
better, then leave me alone.

667
00:35:58,566 --> 00:35:59,666
Please?

668
00:35:59,668 --> 00:36:00,868
<i>See, there's nothing</i>

669
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,202
<i>a cop hates worse
than a missing child.</i>

670
00:36:02,204 --> 00:36:04,805
<i>My kid brother's son.
Today is his first birthday.</i>

671
00:36:04,807 --> 00:36:06,173
<i>Oh, but if anybody</i>

672
00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:08,508
<i>can find that child,
it's you, Roman.</i>

673
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:11,045
<i>Because you're
a wonderful policeman.</i>

674
00:36:11,047 --> 00:36:13,847
<i>This is a holdup.</i>

675
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:15,950
<i>All right, get your hands up,
turn your back.</i>

676
00:36:15,952 --> 00:36:17,217
<i>Put your hands behind</i>

677
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:18,718
<i>your heads
and keep them there!</i>

678
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,120
<i>Don't move!</i>

679
00:36:20,122 --> 00:36:23,223
<i>Drop that.
All right, now get over there.</i>

680
00:36:23,225 --> 00:36:25,692
<i>Watch the door.</i>

681
00:36:25,694 --> 00:36:26,963
<i>You think I'm kiddin'?</i>

682
00:36:30,598 --> 00:36:31,731
<i>Now.</i>

683
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:36,837
<i>I said now!</i>

684
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,572
<i>I got it! Come on,
I tell you, come on!</i>

685
00:36:41,243 --> 00:36:42,845
<i>You wanna get killed?</i>

686
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:40,102
Uh-oh.

687
00:38:16,939 --> 00:38:20,240
No, no, no!

688
00:38:22,945 --> 00:38:25,114
No!

689
00:38:26,415 --> 00:38:29,016
No, no, no.

690
00:38:29,018 --> 00:38:30,851
No, no, no.

691
00:38:30,853 --> 00:38:33,055
No, no, no!

692
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:44,298
You have powers!

693
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:45,899
Yeah, baby,

694
00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:47,968
and there's not
a scratch on you!

695
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:49,702
Did you go through
the locked door?

696
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,972
Are those your powers?

697
00:38:51,974 --> 00:38:54,074
Who can multiply
like rabbits

698
00:38:54,076 --> 00:38:57,044
and go right through
any solid...

699
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:03,786
Oh, my God!

700
00:39:08,824 --> 00:39:10,257
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, honey.</i>

701
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:12,126
- You weren't gonna call me?
- <i>Oh, hey!</i>

702
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,261
No. I mean, yes, yeah...

703
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:16,696
I just didn't wanna wake you.

704
00:39:16,698 --> 00:39:19,765
The strangest thing just
happened out in the yard.

705
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:20,901
Sounds like I just
woke you up.

706
00:39:20,903 --> 00:39:22,402
<i>No, no.</i>

707
00:39:22,404 --> 00:39:24,104
- It's just, Jack-Jack...
- <i>He had an accident!</i>

708
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:25,172
I knew it!

709
00:39:25,174 --> 00:39:27,107
I'm coming home right now!
I never should have...

710
00:39:27,109 --> 00:39:29,443
No accident. Stay there
and finish your mission.

711
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:30,978
You never should...

712
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,046
What? You don't think
I can do this?

713
00:39:33,048 --> 00:39:35,748
No, no.
Sorry. I misspoke.

714
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,151
Do you need me
to come back?

715
00:39:37,153 --> 00:39:40,020
No, no. No, I've got this.
Everything's great.

716
00:39:40,022 --> 00:39:41,756
What happened
with Jack-Jack?

717
00:39:42,925 --> 00:39:45,159
Nothing.
He's in excellent health.

718
00:39:45,161 --> 00:39:47,261
<i>Well, that's good.</i>

719
00:39:47,263 --> 00:39:49,930
- <i>How was Violet's date?</i>
- Uh...

720
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:51,731
<i>That was tonight, right?</i>

721
00:39:51,733 --> 00:39:54,301
Yes. Good.

722
00:39:54,303 --> 00:39:56,303
All fine and good.

723
00:39:56,305 --> 00:39:58,272
And Jack-Jack went down
with no trouble?

724
00:39:58,274 --> 00:40:00,040
Fine, yes, no trouble.

725
00:40:00,042 --> 00:40:01,909
And Dash got
his homework done?

726
00:40:01,911 --> 00:40:03,177
All done.

727
00:40:03,179 --> 00:40:04,444
So, things haven't
spiraled out

728
00:40:04,446 --> 00:40:05,445
of control
the moment I left?

729
00:40:05,447 --> 00:40:07,314
Amazing as it may seem,

730
00:40:07,316 --> 00:40:09,983
it has been
quite uneventful in fact.

731
00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:11,418
<i>How about you?</i>

732
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,323
I saved a runaway train!

733
00:40:15,891 --> 00:40:17,424
<i>It was so great!</i>

734
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:20,194
The mayor was there to cut
the ribbon on this new train.

735
00:40:20,196 --> 00:40:21,995
<i>Elastigirl pursued the train</i>

736
00:40:21,997 --> 00:40:24,164
<i>and was able
to successfully activate...</i>

737
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:26,466
Blah, blah, blah. He says a
few words, cuts the ribbon...

738
00:40:26,468 --> 00:40:27,801
and the train starts pulling

739
00:40:27,803 --> 00:40:29,336
out of the station
backwards...

740
00:40:29,338 --> 00:40:31,038
<i>...track of
its brand new hovertrain...</i>

741
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,806
<i>...malfunctioned...</i>

742
00:40:32,808 --> 00:40:34,009
<i>...thanking Elastigirl...</i>

743
00:40:35,211 --> 00:40:36,476
<i>Superhero Elastigirl...</i>

744
00:40:36,478 --> 00:40:37,811
<i>Elastigirl...</i>

745
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:41,081
Boom! No casualties!

746
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:42,349
<i>...specialized motorbike,</i>

747
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:43,951
<i>saving all of
the passengers...</i>

748
00:40:43,953 --> 00:40:45,052
<i>One thing
leads to another</i>

749
00:40:45,054 --> 00:40:46,220
<i>and suddenly,
I go after it!</i>

750
00:40:46,222 --> 00:40:48,522
<i>I'm telling you, honey,
it was a saga!</i>

751
00:40:48,524 --> 00:40:50,490
That's fantastic, honey!

752
00:40:50,492 --> 00:40:52,893
And on your first night!

753
00:40:52,895 --> 00:40:55,929
I am so proud of you, really.

754
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:57,464
<i>I'm proud of you, honey.</i>

755
00:40:57,466 --> 00:41:00,133
I know you want to get out
there and you will soon.

756
00:41:00,135 --> 00:41:02,102
And you'll be amazing.

757
00:41:02,104 --> 00:41:03,337
I couldn't have done this

758
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:04,972
if you hadn't
taken over so well.

759
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:06,807
<i>Thanks for handling
everything.</i>

760
00:41:06,809 --> 00:41:08,208
It's nothing.

761
00:41:08,210 --> 00:41:11,311
I love you, honey.
I'll be back soon.

762
00:41:11,313 --> 00:41:14,283
- <i>Sweet dreams.</i>
- Sweet dreams, honey.

763
00:41:30,432 --> 00:41:33,333
"Hey, Dad, it's okay.

764
00:41:33,335 --> 00:41:36,136
"I'll just wait for Mom
to get home."

765
00:41:36,138 --> 00:41:39,108
As if she could...
I know how to...

766
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:41,277
I can do math.

767
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,489
Oh, brother...

768
00:41:56,125 --> 00:41:58,027
Wait for Mom!

769
00:41:59,228 --> 00:42:01,497
What am I,
a substitute parent?

770
00:42:04,266 --> 00:42:06,302
It's not my fault
they changed math.

771
00:42:14,943 --> 00:42:17,277
Come on, buddy.
Come on.

772
00:42:17,279 --> 00:42:20,080
I think I understand
your math assignment.

773
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:23,917
We still have some time
to finish it before your test.

774
00:42:23,919 --> 00:42:25,886
So first, you wanna put
all the numbers

775
00:42:25,888 --> 00:42:27,654
by themselves on one side.

776
00:42:27,656 --> 00:42:29,489
...you change the sign.

777
00:42:29,491 --> 00:42:32,526
That means a plus becomes
a minus and a minus...

778
00:42:32,528 --> 00:42:34,027
You got it?

779
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:35,431
Yeah, baby!

780
00:42:49,445 --> 00:42:52,012
Oh. Uh, hello.

781
00:42:52,014 --> 00:42:53,347
We're in a new house.

782
00:42:53,349 --> 00:42:56,616
I did write my address
on your locker...

783
00:42:56,618 --> 00:42:58,652
in permanent ink.

784
00:42:58,654 --> 00:43:00,954
Oh, is that what that is?

785
00:43:00,956 --> 00:43:02,456
Did you forget?

786
00:43:02,458 --> 00:43:04,493
Forget what?

787
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:07,463
That's funny.

788
00:43:10,532 --> 00:43:12,101
Points for funny.

789
00:43:13,235 --> 00:43:15,369
Oh, was it
the weird outfit?

790
00:43:15,371 --> 00:43:17,971
Because there's a reason.

791
00:43:17,973 --> 00:43:20,107
I'm in a drama class...

792
00:43:20,109 --> 00:43:22,309
and they just wanna do
Shakespeare...

793
00:43:22,311 --> 00:43:24,277
but they're like, "Try to make
it relevant for the kids."

794
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:26,546
So, like, "Oh, superheroes!
Kids love superheroes."

795
00:43:26,548 --> 00:43:27,981
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

796
00:43:27,983 --> 00:43:28,949
You wanna wear
one kind of tights...

797
00:43:28,951 --> 00:43:30,217
and then they're like,

798
00:43:30,219 --> 00:43:31,518
"No, wear these
other kind of tights."

799
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,554
Do I know you?

800
00:43:41,397 --> 00:43:43,563
<i>Many say your speech
today is critical.</i>

801
00:43:43,565 --> 00:43:46,333
<i>Both sides just want the
best for their people.</i>

802
00:43:46,335 --> 00:43:50,203
<i>We are so close to finally
getting peace in the region.</i>

803
00:43:50,205 --> 00:43:52,105
I haven't done this
in a while.

804
00:43:52,107 --> 00:43:54,408
This is good. The train
gives us momentum.

805
00:43:54,410 --> 00:43:56,643
Just go out there and
be your charming self...

806
00:43:56,645 --> 00:43:58,111
and capitalize on it.

807
00:43:58,113 --> 00:44:00,580
Ms. Elastigirl,
they're ready for you.

808
00:44:00,582 --> 00:44:02,351
Hey, stretch a leg.

809
00:44:04,286 --> 00:44:06,019
Thank you, Chad.
It was fun.

810
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:08,290
Ambassador, your documents.
We're moving to the rooftop.

811
00:44:09,291 --> 00:44:11,291
Oh, Madame Ambassador,
hello!

812
00:44:11,293 --> 00:44:12,659
Oh, you are Elastigirl!

813
00:44:12,661 --> 00:44:15,162
This is why now
I'm shaking your hand.

814
00:44:15,164 --> 00:44:17,297
It was so sad
when you went underground.

815
00:44:17,299 --> 00:44:21,301
I am glad to see you back
in your shiny outfit.

816
00:44:21,303 --> 00:44:22,702
That means so much
coming from you.

817
00:44:22,704 --> 00:44:24,037
Good luck
with your speech.

818
00:44:24,039 --> 00:44:25,405
This way, Ambassador.

819
00:44:25,407 --> 00:44:26,740
Bring lasting peace!

820
00:44:26,742 --> 00:44:28,642
I will,
when you defeat evil.

821
00:44:28,644 --> 00:44:30,744
Okay.

822
00:44:30,746 --> 00:44:32,514
Three, two...

823
00:44:33,282 --> 00:44:34,581
For over 15 years,

824
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,183
superheroes have been
in hiding.

825
00:44:36,185 --> 00:44:38,185
Forced into it
by a society

826
00:44:38,187 --> 00:44:39,719
no longer willing
to support them.

827
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:41,354
That may soon be changing...

828
00:44:41,356 --> 00:44:43,791
due to a growing movement
to bring the Supers back.

829
00:44:43,793 --> 00:44:45,625
Here, fresh on the heels
of her own

830
00:44:45,627 --> 00:44:47,561
heroic save
of a runaway train...

831
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:51,097
and sporting a new look,
is the superhero, Elastigirl.

832
00:44:51,099 --> 00:44:52,432
- Welcome!
- Hello, Chad.

833
00:44:52,434 --> 00:44:54,601
All the polls are going
in your direction.

834
00:44:54,603 --> 00:44:56,336
That's true.
Things are good...

835
00:44:56,338 --> 00:44:57,737
Hello.

836
00:44:57,739 --> 00:44:59,439
Uh, hello?

837
00:44:59,441 --> 00:45:01,641
Do I have your attention?

838
00:45:01,643 --> 00:45:03,076
Yes, Chad.

839
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:04,344
Of course I do.

840
00:45:04,346 --> 00:45:06,213
I'm appearing
on your screen.

841
00:45:06,215 --> 00:45:09,282
Reading the words I'm saying
off of another screen.

842
00:45:09,284 --> 00:45:11,184
Screens are everywhere.

843
00:45:11,186 --> 00:45:12,319
We are controlled by screens.

844
00:45:14,122 --> 00:45:19,092
<i>And screens
are controlled by me...</i>

845
00:45:19,094 --> 00:45:20,660
<i>Screenslaver.</i>

846
00:45:20,662 --> 00:45:22,095
Hey!

847
00:45:22,097 --> 00:45:24,231
<i>I control this broadcast...</i>

848
00:45:24,233 --> 00:45:26,633
and this idiotic anchorman
you see before you.

849
00:45:26,635 --> 00:45:28,368
What's wrong
with him?

850
00:45:28,370 --> 00:45:29,369
The signal's been hijacked.
I'll check it out.

851
00:45:29,371 --> 00:45:31,137
Don't look at any monitors.

852
00:45:31,139 --> 00:45:33,406
I could hijack
the ambassador's aerocade...

853
00:45:33,408 --> 00:45:35,709
while it's still airborne.

854
00:45:35,711 --> 00:45:37,513
Right, Elastigirl?

855
00:45:39,615 --> 00:45:42,217
Nearest window!
Where's the nearest window?

856
00:45:54,530 --> 00:45:56,396
- Oh, what's going on?
- Where's Elastigirl?

857
00:45:56,398 --> 00:45:58,133
Which one?

858
00:46:06,642 --> 00:46:08,542
Elastigirl!
What are you doing here?

859
00:46:08,544 --> 00:46:10,878
The ambassador is in danger.
Which chopper is she...

860
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,414
Look out!

861
00:46:13,883 --> 00:46:16,251
Follow them
and get me close!

862
00:46:18,754 --> 00:46:21,557
Get out of the sky,
and touch down safely!

863
00:46:30,499 --> 00:46:34,134
Stand down! It's Elastigirl.

864
00:46:34,136 --> 00:46:35,737
Stay in your seat, ma'am!

865
00:46:42,411 --> 00:46:44,544
We're under attack!

866
00:46:44,546 --> 00:46:47,516
Quick, go!
Protect the ambassador!

867
00:46:50,887 --> 00:46:52,185
Open the door!

868
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:53,388
Do as she says!

869
00:46:55,424 --> 00:46:56,523
Can you all swim?

870
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:58,193
- Yeah.
- No!

871
00:47:19,514 --> 00:47:22,482
We're gonna have
to slingshot! Hang on!

872
00:47:29,491 --> 00:47:31,826
Are you all right, ma'am?

873
00:47:31,828 --> 00:47:33,629
I'm perfectly fine...

874
00:47:35,865 --> 00:47:37,432
Ah! Ooh! Ah! Oh!

875
00:47:43,438 --> 00:47:46,239
Boys are jerks
and superheroes suck.

876
00:47:46,241 --> 00:47:47,540
Good morning!

877
00:47:47,542 --> 00:47:49,442
He takes one look
at me in that suit...

878
00:47:49,444 --> 00:47:53,346
and decides to pretend
he doesn't even know me.

879
00:47:53,348 --> 00:47:55,448
He's protecting himself.

880
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:58,318
If he really did see you,
it's best that he forget.

881
00:47:58,320 --> 00:48:00,253
It's better for you, too.

882
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,355
I can't tell you
how many memories

883
00:48:02,357 --> 00:48:04,658
Dicker's had to erase
over the years...

884
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,459
when someone figured out

885
00:48:06,461 --> 00:48:08,261
your mother's
or my identity.

886
00:48:08,263 --> 00:48:10,597
It was Dicker!

887
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:12,833
- You told him about Tony!
- Honey...

888
00:48:12,835 --> 00:48:15,771
You had me erased
from Tony's mind!

889
00:48:29,284 --> 00:48:30,985
I hate superheroes!

890
00:48:30,987 --> 00:48:33,288
And I renounce them!

891
00:48:39,327 --> 00:48:41,261
I renounce them!

892
00:48:49,906 --> 00:48:51,806
Is she having adolescence?

893
00:48:52,975 --> 00:48:54,641
<i>A new report
out today shows that,</i>

894
00:48:54,643 --> 00:48:56,476
<i>when it comes
to decision-making...</i>

895
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:58,311
<i>people have more trust
in a monkey</i>

896
00:48:58,313 --> 00:48:59,679
<i>throwing darts than Congress.</i>

897
00:48:59,681 --> 00:49:01,849
What's going on, Tommy?
A protest?

898
00:49:01,851 --> 00:49:03,951
They're here in support.

899
00:49:03,953 --> 00:49:06,286
Support? Support of what?

900
00:49:06,288 --> 00:49:08,856
Well, in support of you.

901
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:13,961
Wow. Oh, hey...

902
00:49:13,963 --> 00:49:16,596
Thanks for coming out. Hi.

903
00:49:16,598 --> 00:49:19,365
Oh, my goodness.
Thanks so much.

904
00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:20,500
Oh, hello.

905
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:21,871
What does your sign say?

906
00:49:26,341 --> 00:49:27,908
Ka-boom! Ka-pow!

907
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:30,510
Supers should be legal now!

908
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:32,813
Talk to ya.
Oh, what do ya know!

909
00:49:32,815 --> 00:49:33,914
Ellenwood.

910
00:49:33,916 --> 00:49:35,950
Oh, now you wanna
return my calls

911
00:49:35,952 --> 00:49:37,317
about superheroes, huh?

912
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:39,019
Oh. I'll have to
call you back.

913
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:40,420
Oh, that felt good.

914
00:49:40,422 --> 00:49:41,621
Felicia, hold my calls,
please.

915
00:49:41,623 --> 00:49:43,423
Hey!
It's working!

916
00:49:43,425 --> 00:49:45,558
Hey, the ambassador
made a big speech

917
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,760
about superheroes today.

918
00:49:46,762 --> 00:49:48,495
Turns out
saving someone's life

919
00:49:48,497 --> 00:49:49,897
makes a good impression
on them. Who knew, huh?

920
00:49:49,899 --> 00:49:52,398
I'm getting calls
from all over the world.

921
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,802
Media awareness
is up 72%.

922
00:49:54,804 --> 00:49:56,904
The push
for superhero legalization

923
00:49:56,906 --> 00:49:58,906
is becoming
a worldwide movement!

924
00:49:58,908 --> 00:50:00,808
I have big plans
for our next move.

925
00:50:00,810 --> 00:50:02,642
We're gonna have
a summit at sea.

926
00:50:02,644 --> 00:50:03,743
We'll use our ship...

927
00:50:03,745 --> 00:50:05,980
we'll gather leaders
and Supers...

928
00:50:05,982 --> 00:50:08,715
- from all over the world.
- That's great.

929
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:09,850
I'm happy.

930
00:50:09,852 --> 00:50:11,518
I'm happy
the numbers are up.

931
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,621
I'm happy the ambassador
is pro-superhero...

932
00:50:14,623 --> 00:50:16,389
and I'm happy
you're happy.

933
00:50:16,391 --> 00:50:19,659
I'm hearing that you're happy,
but why am I not feeling it?

934
00:50:19,661 --> 00:50:21,394
Because I didn't get him!

935
00:50:21,396 --> 00:50:22,797
Screenslaver
is still out there.

936
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:25,632
All I did was play his game
and win this round.

937
00:50:25,634 --> 00:50:26,801
He's gonna want more

938
00:50:26,803 --> 00:50:28,936
and as long as
he gets to play, he wins.

939
00:50:28,938 --> 00:50:31,005
One thing
I've learned in business?

940
00:50:31,007 --> 00:50:32,940
Smell the flowers.

941
00:50:32,942 --> 00:50:34,474
They don't bloom that often.

942
00:50:34,476 --> 00:50:35,943
What do you want
on your tombstone?

943
00:50:35,945 --> 00:50:37,077
"She worried a lot"?

944
00:50:37,079 --> 00:50:39,079
All right,
stop talking.

945
00:50:39,081 --> 00:50:40,482
Show her.

946
00:50:45,554 --> 00:50:48,555
This is just so exciting, isn't it?
Huh?

947
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,492
Oh, wow. Uh...

948
00:50:52,494 --> 00:50:55,695
Wow! Elastigirl,
there you are.

949
00:50:55,697 --> 00:50:57,131
- Hello.
- I didn't...

950
00:50:57,133 --> 00:50:58,598
Wow!

951
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,935
Come on, get yourself
together, Karen.

952
00:51:00,937 --> 00:51:04,038
Hi, my superhero name
is Voyd.

953
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:08,042
I just wanna thank you,
for, like, for being you!

954
00:51:09,979 --> 00:51:13,582
Okay, what I can do,
um, is this.

955
00:51:18,687 --> 00:51:20,753
Yeah.

956
00:51:20,755 --> 00:51:24,524
That is impressive.
Very interdimensional.

957
00:51:24,526 --> 00:51:26,726
I felt like
an outcast before.

958
00:51:26,728 --> 00:51:31,464
But now, with you being
you, I feel like...

959
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:33,870
Yay, me.

960
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:36,904
I flew them in
from all over.

961
00:51:36,906 --> 00:51:38,771
They've all been
in hiding.

962
00:51:38,773 --> 00:51:40,975
They have powers,
secret identities...

963
00:51:40,977 --> 00:51:43,844
and names
they've given themselves.

964
00:51:43,846 --> 00:51:46,146
I'm Screech.
It's a pleasure.

965
00:51:46,148 --> 00:51:47,547
I've always considered you

966
00:51:47,549 --> 00:51:49,616
the gold standard
for superheroes.

967
00:51:49,618 --> 00:51:51,751
Well, thanks.
You're too nice.

968
00:51:51,753 --> 00:51:53,653
I am called Brick.

969
00:51:53,655 --> 00:51:57,024
Nice to meet you, Brick.
Uh, where are you from?

970
00:51:57,026 --> 00:51:58,591
Wisconsin.

971
00:51:58,593 --> 00:52:01,728
Oh. Elastigirl.
I assume your powers are...

972
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:03,998
You know,
zapping things electrically...

973
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,532
charging things, bolts of
lightning, that kind of stuff.

974
00:52:06,534 --> 00:52:08,002
Name's Reflux.

975
00:52:08,004 --> 00:52:10,971
Medical condition or
superpower, you decide.

976
00:52:10,973 --> 00:52:12,605
That's a little line

977
00:52:12,607 --> 00:52:14,041
I say just to put
people at ease.

978
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:15,175
Hope I don't offend.

979
00:52:15,177 --> 00:52:17,211
Oh, no, no, no.
Reflux. Love it.

980
00:52:18,647 --> 00:52:21,547
Well, I do look forward
to working with you.

981
00:52:21,549 --> 00:52:24,617
Yes, that is impressive.
Keep practicing.

982
00:52:25,988 --> 00:52:27,520
Ow!

983
00:52:30,558 --> 00:52:33,928
Well, I'm beat. Congratulations.
Big day.

984
00:52:33,930 --> 00:52:36,496
Good night, ladies.
I will see you tomorrow.

985
00:52:36,498 --> 00:52:37,798
Good night.

986
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,499
Must be nice for you,

987
00:52:39,501 --> 00:52:41,068
being out front
after all this time.

988
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,635
Out front?

989
00:52:42,637 --> 00:52:45,205
Well, it's been a while
since your superhero days...

990
00:52:45,207 --> 00:52:47,041
and even then,
you were kind of

991
00:52:47,043 --> 00:52:48,641
in Mr. Incredible's
shadow.

992
00:52:48,643 --> 00:52:50,077
Nah, I beg to differ.

993
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,079
I'm not... I'm not
saying you weren't big.

994
00:52:52,081 --> 00:52:54,081
No, you were,
and are, a superstar...

995
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:57,017
but you have the stage
to yourself now.

996
00:52:57,019 --> 00:52:59,053
And people have
to pay attention.

997
00:52:59,055 --> 00:53:00,854
Oh, you mean, "It's a man's
world" and all that?

998
00:53:00,856 --> 00:53:02,722
Well, what world
do you live in?

999
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:04,058
Your brother runs DEVTECH.

1000
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:08,195
I don't want his job.
I invent, he sells.

1001
00:53:08,197 --> 00:53:11,764
I ask you, which of us
has the greater influence?

1002
00:53:11,766 --> 00:53:13,233
Which side of me
are you asking?

1003
00:53:13,235 --> 00:53:14,701
The believer or the cynic?

1004
00:53:14,703 --> 00:53:15,970
The cynic...

1005
00:53:15,972 --> 00:53:17,704
Would say selling
is more important

1006
00:53:17,706 --> 00:53:19,739
because the best sellers
have the most buyers.

1007
00:53:19,741 --> 00:53:21,541
Doesn't matter
what you're selling.

1008
00:53:21,543 --> 00:53:23,277
It only matters
what people buy.

1009
00:53:23,279 --> 00:53:24,979
This is true.

1010
00:53:24,981 --> 00:53:26,947
If I discovered the
origin of the universe...

1011
00:53:26,949 --> 00:53:28,581
my brother
would find a way

1012
00:53:28,583 --> 00:53:31,551
to market it as a,
uh, foot massager.

1013
00:53:33,889 --> 00:53:35,789
So, what would
the believer say?

1014
00:53:35,791 --> 00:53:38,125
The believer would tell you
to make your mark.

1015
00:53:38,127 --> 00:53:40,593
Don't wait for permission,
assert yourself

1016
00:53:40,595 --> 00:53:42,096
and impose your will
on the status quo.

1017
00:53:42,098 --> 00:53:43,964
- Sounds like my brother.
- What?

1018
00:53:43,966 --> 00:53:45,265
You sound like my brother.

1019
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:46,666
Well, he's not wrong.

1020
00:53:46,668 --> 00:53:48,002
There is an art
to getting a reaction...

1021
00:53:48,004 --> 00:53:49,736
Oh! I know
how to get him.

1022
00:53:49,738 --> 00:53:52,772
- My brother?
- No. Screenslaver!

1023
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:55,575
You're tech-savvy. I need
to lock onto a signal...

1024
00:53:55,577 --> 00:53:56,743
and trace its origin.

1025
00:53:56,745 --> 00:53:57,878
How fast can you
slap something together

1026
00:53:57,880 --> 00:53:59,079
and meet me
at the airport?

1027
00:53:59,081 --> 00:54:00,080
Airport?

1028
00:54:00,082 --> 00:54:01,849
Need to go
out of town, pronto.

1029
00:54:01,851 --> 00:54:03,017
I can get your contraption
together by 5:00 a.m.

1030
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:05,119
I need to get on TV.
Chad!

1031
00:54:05,121 --> 00:54:06,887
I'll get my brother to set up
an exclusive with him

1032
00:54:06,889 --> 00:54:08,055
tonight on the newscast.

1033
00:54:08,057 --> 00:54:09,256
Finish our interview
by phone!

1034
00:54:09,258 --> 00:54:10,623
Promote the hell out of it.

1035
00:54:10,625 --> 00:54:12,026
Independence
from Screenslavery!

1036
00:54:12,028 --> 00:54:14,862
- Chad tonight.
- Boom!

1037
00:54:18,034 --> 00:54:19,699
- Dicker.
- <i>Yeah, hey, Rick.</i>

1038
00:54:19,701 --> 00:54:21,301
You remember that kid
I mentioned to you?

1039
00:54:21,303 --> 00:54:22,602
Tony Rydinger.

1040
00:54:22,604 --> 00:54:24,304
Mind wipe? Yeah, nice kid.

1041
00:54:24,306 --> 00:54:26,006
Well, you also wiped out

1042
00:54:26,008 --> 00:54:28,008
the Friday night date
my daughter had with him.

1043
00:54:28,010 --> 00:54:30,643
In fact,
you wiped out my daughter.

1044
00:54:30,645 --> 00:54:32,913
Oops.
Not an exact science, Bob.

1045
00:54:32,915 --> 00:54:34,782
<i>Rick, you gotta help me here.</i>

1046
00:54:34,784 --> 00:54:37,818
Violet hates me, and you,
and superheroes.

1047
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,320
I gotta fix this.
What do you know about Tony?

1048
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:41,721
Um...

1049
00:54:41,723 --> 00:54:43,190
Not much.

1050
00:54:43,192 --> 00:54:44,792
Seems like a good kid.

1051
00:54:44,794 --> 00:54:46,960
Popular,
plays sports, music.

1052
00:54:46,962 --> 00:54:50,798
Parents own The Happy Platter,
kid works there part time.

1053
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:52,968
Happy Platter?

1054
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:58,205
Why did we drive
all the way across town

1055
00:54:58,207 --> 00:55:00,007
for The Happy Platter?

1056
00:55:00,009 --> 00:55:03,643
We'd like a booth over there,
near the philodendron.

1057
00:55:03,645 --> 00:55:05,779
Good, right?
Near the philodendron.

1058
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:11,218
This platter doesn't look
all that happy to me.

1059
00:55:11,220 --> 00:55:13,187
It looks bored.

1060
00:55:13,189 --> 00:55:15,089
Ha-ha! The Bored Platter!

1061
00:55:15,091 --> 00:55:17,657
I thought Vi would want
a change of pace

1062
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:18,826
from drive-in food.

1063
00:55:18,828 --> 00:55:20,726
I like drive-in food.

1064
00:55:20,728 --> 00:55:22,695
Does this mean vegetables?

1065
00:55:22,697 --> 00:55:24,697
A balanced diet
means vegetables, kiddo.

1066
00:55:24,699 --> 00:55:26,800
Get used to it.

1067
00:55:26,802 --> 00:55:28,836
Good evening, everyone.

1068
00:55:28,838 --> 00:55:30,437
Oh, no!

1069
00:55:30,439 --> 00:55:32,039
- Is she all right?
- Violet, are you okay?

1070
00:55:32,041 --> 00:55:33,240
Nothing to see here.

1071
00:55:33,242 --> 00:55:35,008
Yeah, more napkins
would be good.

1072
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:36,143
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- It happens all the time here.

1073
00:55:36,145 --> 00:55:37,044
Mops it right up.

1074
00:55:37,046 --> 00:55:39,947
Normally, she doesn't
ever drip like this.

1075
00:55:39,949 --> 00:55:42,116
- Would you like water, sir?
- Yes.

1076
00:55:42,118 --> 00:55:45,085
Yes, I would.
This is my daughter...

1077
00:55:45,087 --> 00:55:46,787
- who you must know, right?
- God. Stop.

1078
00:55:46,789 --> 00:55:48,122
- Hello.
- Violet.

1079
00:55:48,124 --> 00:55:49,289
Hello, Violet.

1080
00:55:50,426 --> 00:55:51,892
Hey, Vi, say hi to...

1081
00:55:51,894 --> 00:55:53,260
Don't push it, Dad.

1082
00:55:53,262 --> 00:55:55,262
I'm Dash,
her little brother.

1083
00:55:55,264 --> 00:55:56,430
Hello.

1084
00:55:56,432 --> 00:55:58,899
Mmm. This is
really good water.

1085
00:55:58,901 --> 00:56:00,200
It's very refreshing.

1086
00:56:00,202 --> 00:56:01,068
Spring water, is it?

1087
00:56:01,070 --> 00:56:03,971
I don't know, sir.
I think it's tap.

1088
00:56:03,973 --> 00:56:05,738
Well, it is very good.

1089
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,141
Excellent tap.

1090
00:56:07,143 --> 00:56:09,276
Excuse me.

1091
00:56:09,278 --> 00:56:11,111
Well, nice to meet you.

1092
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:12,846
- Where'd she go?
- Mmm.

1093
00:56:12,848 --> 00:56:15,949
To find a good place
to be angry?

1094
00:56:15,951 --> 00:56:18,852
Tonight, we go now to
a special remote interview...

1095
00:56:18,854 --> 00:56:20,053
with Elastigirl.

1096
00:56:20,055 --> 00:56:21,088
<i>How you feeling, Chad?</i>

1097
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:22,356
<i>You doing all right?</i>

1098
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:24,858
I'm fine.
The doctors checked me out.

1099
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,860
I have no memory
of the event.

1100
00:56:26,862 --> 00:56:28,761
I gotta tell you,
it's pretty strange

1101
00:56:28,763 --> 00:56:30,130
to see a recording...

1102
00:56:30,132 --> 00:56:32,799
<i>of yourself the night before
and have no recollection.</i>

1103
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:34,368
<i>I don't think
anyone needs to worry.</i>

1104
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:36,837
<i>We've taken many precautions
tonight though.</i>

1105
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:38,172
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

1106
00:56:38,174 --> 00:56:41,208
On a case, in a secure
undisclosed location.

1107
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:42,910
<i>I wanna talk
about you...</i>

1108
00:56:42,912 --> 00:56:45,312
<i>starting with your save
of a runaway train.</i>

1109
00:56:45,314 --> 00:56:47,881
<i>Here's an exclusive
unedited clip</i>

1110
00:56:47,883 --> 00:56:49,316
<i>from your own suit cam.</i>

1111
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:50,417
<i>Roll the clip.</i>

1112
00:56:50,419 --> 00:56:53,187
<i>This thing's
really moving.</i>

1113
00:56:53,189 --> 00:56:55,923
<i>100 and climbing.
How much track is built?</i>

1114
00:56:55,925 --> 00:56:58,859
<i>About 25 miles.</i>

1115
00:56:58,861 --> 00:57:02,062
<i>The Screenslaver
interrupts this program...</i>

1116
00:57:02,064 --> 00:57:03,497
<i>for an important announcement.</i>

1117
00:57:03,499 --> 00:57:05,399
I'll be damned. She knew.

1118
00:57:05,401 --> 00:57:07,167
Let's see
if your gadget works.

1119
00:57:07,169 --> 00:57:09,436
<i>Don't bother
watching the rest.</i>

1120
00:57:09,438 --> 00:57:10,938
Gotcha!

1121
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,173
<i>Elastigirl doesn't
save the day.</i>

1122
00:57:13,175 --> 00:57:16,043
<i>She only postpones her defeat.</i>

1123
00:57:16,045 --> 00:57:18,245
<i>And while she postpones
her defeat...</i>

1124
00:57:18,247 --> 00:57:21,915
<i>you eat chips and watch
her confront problems...</i>

1125
00:57:21,917 --> 00:57:24,184
<i>that you are too lazy
to deal with.</i>

1126
00:57:24,186 --> 00:57:27,087
<i>Superheroes are part
of your brainless desire...</i>

1127
00:57:27,089 --> 00:57:30,324
<i>to replace true experience
with simulation.</i>

1128
00:57:30,326 --> 00:57:33,827
<i>You don't talk,
you watch talk shows.</i>

1129
00:57:33,829 --> 00:57:37,397
<i>You don't play games,
you watch game shows.</i>

1130
00:57:37,399 --> 00:57:40,467
<i>Travel, relationships, risk...</i>

1131
00:57:40,469 --> 00:57:43,403
<i>every meaningful experience
must be packaged...</i>

1132
00:57:43,405 --> 00:57:46,974
<i>and delivered to you
to watch at a distance.</i>

1133
00:57:46,976 --> 00:57:49,443
<i>So that you can remain
ever sheltered...</i>

1134
00:57:49,445 --> 00:57:51,144
<i>ever passive...</i>

1135
00:57:51,146 --> 00:57:53,547
<i>ever ravenous consumers...</i>

1136
00:57:53,549 --> 00:57:56,550
<i>who can't bring themselves
to rise from their couches...</i>

1137
00:57:56,552 --> 00:58:00,988
<i>break a sweat
and participate in life.</i>

1138
00:58:00,990 --> 00:58:03,557
<i>You want superheroes
to protect you...</i>

1139
00:58:03,559 --> 00:58:07,861
<i>and make yourselves ever more
powerless in the process.</i>

1140
00:58:07,863 --> 00:58:11,398
<i>While you tell yourselves
you're being looked after.</i>

1141
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,533
<i>That your interests
are being served.</i>

1142
00:58:13,535 --> 00:58:16,403
<i>And your rights
are being upheld.</i>

1143
00:58:16,405 --> 00:58:19,539
<i>So that the system can
keep stealing from you...</i>

1144
00:58:19,541 --> 00:58:22,409
<i>smiling at you all the while.</i>

1145
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:26,113
<i>Go ahead,
send your Supers to stop me.</i>

1146
00:58:26,115 --> 00:58:28,448
<i>Grab your snacks,
watch your screens,</i>

1147
00:58:28,450 --> 00:58:30,550
<i>and see what happens.</i>

1148
00:58:30,552 --> 00:58:33,587
<i>You are no longer in control.</i>

1149
00:58:33,589 --> 00:58:35,190
<i>I am.</i>

1150
01:00:16,725 --> 01:00:18,460
Find anything?

1151
01:01:09,178 --> 01:01:10,479
Sorry!

1152
01:01:42,711 --> 01:01:44,211
What happened?

1153
01:01:44,213 --> 01:01:47,280
What happened is
you destroyed my evidence.

1154
01:01:47,282 --> 01:01:49,049
What's going on?
What did I do?

1155
01:01:49,051 --> 01:01:50,517
What did you guys do to me?

1156
01:01:50,519 --> 01:01:54,287
That's right, punk.
Blame the system.

1157
01:01:54,289 --> 01:01:56,189
Your tracker worked
like a charm, Evelyn.

1158
01:01:56,191 --> 01:01:57,457
<i>You're a genius.</i>

1159
01:01:57,459 --> 01:01:58,358
Aw, shucks!

1160
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:01,161
I'm just the genius
behind the genius.

1161
01:02:01,163 --> 01:02:03,530
Hey, Dad.

1162
01:02:03,532 --> 01:02:07,534
We're doing fractions
and denismals and percentages

1163
01:02:07,536 --> 01:02:08,602
and I don't get 'em.

1164
01:02:08,604 --> 01:02:09,736
Aren't you...

1165
01:02:09,738 --> 01:02:11,204
Didn't we get all caught up?

1166
01:02:11,206 --> 01:02:12,639
Yeah, we were caught up...

1167
01:02:12,641 --> 01:02:16,109
and now we're doing fractions
and percentages and demicels.

1168
01:02:16,111 --> 01:02:17,477
Decimals.

1169
01:02:17,479 --> 01:02:18,779
<i>...the
addition of the Incredibile,</i>

1170
01:02:18,781 --> 01:02:20,180
<i>the super car...</i>

1171
01:02:20,182 --> 01:02:22,549
<i>once driven by superhero,
Mr. Incredible.</i>

1172
01:02:22,551 --> 01:02:25,519
<i>It's the kind of thing you buy
when you have everything else.</i>

1173
01:02:25,521 --> 01:02:27,855
They said it was
beyond repair.

1174
01:02:27,857 --> 01:02:29,389
<i>Hey,
it was in perfect condition.</i>

1175
01:02:29,391 --> 01:02:31,191
You used to
drive that?

1176
01:02:31,193 --> 01:02:32,692
They said it was destroyed.

1177
01:02:32,694 --> 01:02:34,561
<i>Long thought lost
or destroyed,</i>

1178
01:02:34,563 --> 01:02:36,730
<i>the famous car
turned up at private auction.</i>

1179
01:02:36,732 --> 01:02:38,231
They said it was...

1180
01:02:38,233 --> 01:02:40,233
That's my car!

1181
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:50,610
Stupid water feature!

1182
01:02:50,612 --> 01:02:53,380
<i>This car is just loaded
with amazing gadgets.</i>

1183
01:02:53,382 --> 01:02:54,548
<i>Care to demonstrate?</i>

1184
01:02:54,550 --> 01:02:56,716
<i>I'd love to,
but we haven't figured out</i>

1185
01:02:56,718 --> 01:02:58,285
<i>how to make them work yet.</i>

1186
01:03:00,222 --> 01:03:03,358
Wow! It works?

1187
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,826
Huh?

1188
01:03:05,828 --> 01:03:08,295
What are you doing?
This is not a toy!

1189
01:03:08,297 --> 01:03:09,563
That's a rocket launcher!

1190
01:03:09,565 --> 01:03:11,565
Sweet! Which one launches
the rocket?

1191
01:03:11,567 --> 01:03:13,300
Hey!
This is not your car!

1192
01:03:13,302 --> 01:03:14,634
It's not your car,
either!

1193
01:03:14,636 --> 01:03:16,436
It is so!
It's the Incredibile.

1194
01:03:16,438 --> 01:03:18,471
- Why's that guy have it?
- He shouldn't!

1195
01:03:18,473 --> 01:03:20,240
Launch the rockets!
Launch the rockets!

1196
01:03:20,242 --> 01:03:21,708
Launch the rockets!

1197
01:03:21,710 --> 01:03:23,243
- I'm not launching anything!
- I wanna blow it up!

1198
01:03:23,245 --> 01:03:24,311
Do you think I want
an angry rich guy...

1199
01:03:24,313 --> 01:03:25,813
coming after me right now...

1200
01:03:25,815 --> 01:03:27,547
- when I'm trying not to...
- <i>I'm not sure</i>

1201
01:03:27,549 --> 01:03:28,615
- <i>what's happened here, Mark.</i>
- ...distract your mother.

1202
01:03:28,617 --> 01:03:30,317
<i>But everyone here
has scattered</i>

1203
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:32,218
<i>and I'm afraid I'll need
to move at any minute.</i>

1204
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,756
Rich guy got my car.

1205
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:39,392
So, you're not gonna
steal your car

1206
01:03:39,394 --> 01:03:40,797
back from the rich guy?

1207
01:03:49,504 --> 01:03:51,571
What the heck is that?

1208
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:57,344
Jack-Jack has powers?

1209
01:03:57,346 --> 01:03:58,478
Well, yeah, but...

1210
01:03:58,480 --> 01:03:59,914
- You knew about this?
- Yeah.

1211
01:03:59,916 --> 01:04:01,748
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I don't know.

1212
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:04,284
We're your kids. We need
to know these things.

1213
01:04:04,286 --> 01:04:05,585
- Did you tell Mom?
- No.

1214
01:04:05,587 --> 01:04:07,487
- Why not?
- Your mother is not...

1215
01:04:07,489 --> 01:04:09,222
You'd want us to tell you,
wouldn't you?

1216
01:04:09,224 --> 01:04:10,557
- Why would you not tell Mom?
- Because I didn't wanna...

1217
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:11,758
What?

1218
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:12,960
- Come on, man.
- Because it's not the time.

1219
01:04:12,962 --> 01:04:14,227
- Why?
- Because...

1220
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:15,328
So uncool!

1221
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:17,464
Because I'm formulating, okay?

1222
01:04:17,466 --> 01:04:20,367
I'm taking in information,
I'm processing!

1223
01:04:20,369 --> 01:04:22,435
I'm doing the math,
I'm fixing the boyfriend...

1224
01:04:22,437 --> 01:04:23,670
and keeping the baby

1225
01:04:23,672 --> 01:04:24,905
from turning into
a flaming monster!

1226
01:04:24,907 --> 01:04:26,341
How do I do it?

1227
01:04:27,309 --> 01:04:29,476
By rolling with
the punches, baby!

1228
01:04:29,478 --> 01:04:32,212
I eat thunder
and crap lightning, okay?

1229
01:04:32,214 --> 01:04:33,781
'Cause I'm Mr. Incredible!

1230
01:04:33,783 --> 01:04:37,317
Not Mr. So-So
or Mr. Mediocre-Guy.

1231
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:39,887
Mr. Incredible!

1232
01:04:41,523 --> 01:04:43,757
We should call Lucius.

1233
01:04:43,759 --> 01:04:45,425
No. I can handle it.

1234
01:04:45,427 --> 01:04:47,761
There's no way I'm gonna...

1235
01:04:56,839 --> 01:04:58,607
Dada.

1236
01:04:59,408 --> 01:05:01,541
I'm calling Lucius.

1237
01:05:04,814 --> 01:05:07,547
Looks normal to me. When
did this start happening?

1238
01:05:07,549 --> 01:05:09,582
Since Helen got the job.

1239
01:05:09,584 --> 01:05:11,518
- I assume she knows?
- Are you kidding?

1240
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:12,820
I can't tell her
about this,

1241
01:05:12,822 --> 01:05:14,354
not while she's doing
hero work!

1242
01:05:14,356 --> 01:05:15,655
Mama!

1243
01:05:15,657 --> 01:05:17,024
<i>Girls, come on.</i>

1244
01:05:17,026 --> 01:05:18,558
<i>Leave the saving the world
to the men?</i>

1245
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:19,927
- <i>I don't think so.</i>
- Mama!

1246
01:05:19,929 --> 01:05:21,796
I've got to succeed!

1247
01:05:21,798 --> 01:05:23,496
So she can succeed.

1248
01:05:23,498 --> 01:05:25,966
- So we can succeed!
- I get it, Bob!

1249
01:05:25,968 --> 01:05:28,936
I get it. When was the
last time you slept?

1250
01:05:28,938 --> 01:05:30,770
Who keeps track of that?

1251
01:05:30,772 --> 01:05:32,338
Besides, he's a baby.

1252
01:05:32,340 --> 01:05:34,708
I can handle it,
I got this handled.

1253
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:36,643
So, you good then?

1254
01:05:36,645 --> 01:05:39,046
You got everything
under control? Right?

1255
01:05:41,884 --> 01:05:43,316
What the...?

1256
01:05:44,419 --> 01:05:46,486
Cookie! Cha Cha want a cookie?

1257
01:05:46,488 --> 01:05:49,422
Num-num cookie?
Cha Cha wanna num-num?

1258
01:05:49,424 --> 01:05:52,292
Num-num cookie! Cookie!

1259
01:05:52,294 --> 01:05:53,460
- You're not...
- Cookie!

1260
01:05:53,462 --> 01:05:54,761
- Oh, my God!
- Cookie!

1261
01:05:54,763 --> 01:05:56,763
- Dada! Dada. Dada.
- Whoa.

1262
01:05:56,765 --> 01:05:58,565
Okay! Okay.

1263
01:05:58,567 --> 01:06:00,533
So, he can still
hear you from the...

1264
01:06:00,535 --> 01:06:02,569
From the other
dimension, yeah.

1265
01:06:02,571 --> 01:06:04,671
That is freaky.
I mean, that's not like...

1266
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:07,707
Not like our other kids.
No, it is not.

1267
01:06:07,709 --> 01:06:10,410
Full powers, totally random.

1268
01:06:10,412 --> 01:06:12,746
So now, he's what?
Is he good?

1269
01:06:12,748 --> 01:06:14,882
Yeah, you'd think so,
right?

1270
01:06:14,884 --> 01:06:17,985
Obviously, I can't keep
giving him cookies!

1271
01:06:17,987 --> 01:06:19,954
- Uh-uh?
- But if I stop...

1272
01:06:23,525 --> 01:06:25,525
Ahhh! He is freaking!
Again, he is freaking!

1273
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:27,027
No biting the daddy!

1274
01:06:27,029 --> 01:06:28,396
- What the...?
- No biting!

1275
01:06:33,970 --> 01:06:36,404
Okay.

1276
01:06:37,807 --> 01:06:40,908
I think I just need
a little bit of me time.

1277
01:06:40,910 --> 01:06:42,442
Then I'll be good to go.

1278
01:06:42,444 --> 01:06:44,611
Oh, you need
more than me time, Bob.

1279
01:06:44,613 --> 01:06:46,513
You need
major life realignment

1280
01:06:46,515 --> 01:06:47,747
on a number of levels.

1281
01:06:47,749 --> 01:06:50,517
Starting with
baby superfreak here!

1282
01:06:50,519 --> 01:06:54,389
You need some solid
outside-the-box thinking.

1283
01:07:02,932 --> 01:07:04,531
<i>Galbaki?</i>

1284
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:08,601
<i>Elastigirl's supersuit
is by Galbaki?</i>

1285
01:07:08,603 --> 01:07:10,070
<i>Explain yourself!</i>

1286
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:15,876
<i>Oh, my God.
You're worse than I thought.</i>

1287
01:07:15,878 --> 01:07:18,979
<i>It's the baby.
I brought the baby.</i>

1288
01:07:20,549 --> 01:07:22,819
<i>Oh, highly unusual.</i>

1289
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:31,959
You look ghastly, Robert.

1290
01:07:31,961 --> 01:07:34,128
I haven't been sleeping.

1291
01:07:34,130 --> 01:07:37,832
I broke my daughter,
they keep changing math...

1292
01:07:37,834 --> 01:07:40,901
we needed double-A batteries,
but I got triple-A's...

1293
01:07:40,903 --> 01:07:43,838
and now we still need
double-A batteries.

1294
01:07:43,840 --> 01:07:46,140
I put one red thing
in a load of whites

1295
01:07:46,142 --> 01:07:48,441
and now
everything's pink.

1296
01:07:48,443 --> 01:07:49,709
And I think
we need eggs.

1297
01:07:49,711 --> 01:07:53,479
Done properly,
parenting is a heroic act.

1298
01:07:53,481 --> 01:07:54,982
Done properly.

1299
01:07:54,984 --> 01:07:58,152
I am fortunate that it has
never afflicted me.

1300
01:07:58,154 --> 01:07:59,854
But you do not come to me

1301
01:07:59,856 --> 01:08:02,488
for eggs and batteries,
Robert.

1302
01:08:02,490 --> 01:08:03,891
I design herowear

1303
01:08:03,893 --> 01:08:06,559
and Elastigirl
must have a new suit.

1304
01:08:06,561 --> 01:08:09,163
Actually,
it's Jack-Jack.

1305
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:11,999
You also wish
a new suit for the baby?

1306
01:08:12,001 --> 01:08:16,036
I would hardly classify
this as an emergency.

1307
01:08:16,038 --> 01:08:18,806
Well, he's a special case.
Worth studying.

1308
01:08:18,808 --> 01:08:20,908
If I could just leave him
with you for a while...

1309
01:08:20,910 --> 01:08:22,744
Leave him? Here?

1310
01:08:23,846 --> 01:08:25,980
I am not a baby person,
Robert.

1311
01:08:25,982 --> 01:08:28,949
I have no baby facilities.
I am an artist.

1312
01:08:28,951 --> 01:08:32,021
I do not involve myself in
the prosaic day-to-day to...

1313
01:08:32,989 --> 01:08:34,489
day.

1314
01:08:37,626 --> 01:08:39,594
Fascinating!

1315
01:08:42,031 --> 01:08:43,900
Are you seeing this, Robert?

1316
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:46,903
Dada.

1317
01:08:55,845 --> 01:08:58,781
Oh, my God.

1318
01:08:59,714 --> 01:09:01,048
Yes!

1319
01:09:01,050 --> 01:09:02,883
Of course you can leave
the baby overnight.

1320
01:09:02,885 --> 01:09:04,617
I'm sure filling in
for Helen is challenging,

1321
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:05,819
and you are very tired...

1322
01:09:05,821 --> 01:09:06,921
and the other children
need you

1323
01:09:06,923 --> 01:09:08,621
and miss you,
and you must go to them.

1324
01:09:08,623 --> 01:09:10,057
Auntie Edna will take care
of everything...

1325
01:09:10,059 --> 01:09:12,862
so, drive safely and goodbye.
I enjoy our visits.

1326
01:09:15,530 --> 01:09:17,197
"Auntie Edna"?

1327
01:09:21,703 --> 01:09:24,004
Attention. Attention.

1328
01:09:24,006 --> 01:09:26,673
I wanna thank everyone
that came out tonight...

1329
01:09:26,675 --> 01:09:28,075
in support of superheroes...

1330
01:09:28,077 --> 01:09:31,678
and bringing them
back into society!

1331
01:09:31,680 --> 01:09:33,280
You all made it happen.

1332
01:09:33,282 --> 01:09:34,714
The need for this
has been made

1333
01:09:34,716 --> 01:09:36,083
crystal clear
in recent days...

1334
01:09:36,085 --> 01:09:38,018
with bad actors
like the self-proclaimed

1335
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:40,187
Screenslaver
threatening our peace.

1336
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:41,789
His reign was short, huh?

1337
01:09:41,791 --> 01:09:43,891
And thanks to this woman...

1338
01:09:43,893 --> 01:09:47,061
a great super. You love her.
You missed her.

1339
01:09:47,063 --> 01:09:50,965
Welcome back, Elastigirl.

1340
01:09:50,967 --> 01:09:53,766
Come on up here.
Don't be bashful.

1341
01:09:53,768 --> 01:09:56,170
Come on. Get up here.

1342
01:09:56,172 --> 01:09:58,973
I want you to have this.

1343
01:09:58,975 --> 01:10:00,740
A memento.

1344
01:10:00,742 --> 01:10:04,111
Thanks, Winston, Evelyn,
and everyone at DEVTECH.

1345
01:10:04,113 --> 01:10:06,113
I am forever in your debt.

1346
01:10:06,115 --> 01:10:07,848
And thanks to all of you,

1347
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:10,951
your pressure
changed all the right minds.

1348
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:13,253
We've made amazing headway
in a very short time...

1349
01:10:13,255 --> 01:10:16,723
which leads me to an
important announcement.

1350
01:10:16,725 --> 01:10:18,926
Just now,
at a worldwide summit...

1351
01:10:18,928 --> 01:10:20,828
leaders from
more than a hundred

1352
01:10:20,830 --> 01:10:22,595
of the world's
top countries...

1353
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:26,133
have agreed to make
superheroes legal again!

1354
01:10:27,937 --> 01:10:29,736
We'll gather superheroes
and leaders

1355
01:10:29,738 --> 01:10:30,938
from all over
the planet...

1356
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,739
on our boat,
the <i>Everjust...</i>

1357
01:10:32,741 --> 01:10:36,110
for a televised
signing ceremony at sea.

1358
01:10:36,112 --> 01:10:40,014
Now if you'll excuse us,
we got a ship to catch!

1359
01:10:43,185 --> 01:10:45,585
So good to see you.
Thanks for coming out.

1360
01:10:45,587 --> 01:10:47,587
Hey.
Hi, it's me, again.

1361
01:10:47,589 --> 01:10:50,723
Um, there's, uh, something
I've always wanted to ask you.

1362
01:10:50,725 --> 01:10:53,293
Yeah, how do you balance
the superhero stuff

1363
01:10:53,295 --> 01:10:55,095
with the life stuff?

1364
01:10:55,097 --> 01:10:57,297
I know I can handle
the superhero stuff.

1365
01:11:00,202 --> 01:11:01,634
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Oh.

1366
01:11:01,636 --> 01:11:03,636
Would you please
excuse me a moment?

1367
01:11:03,638 --> 01:11:06,340
Oh. Yeah, okay, see you later!
Good talk!

1368
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:30,232
- Hey, Vi.
- Hey.

1369
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:32,765
Where's Jack-Jack?

1370
01:11:32,767 --> 01:11:33,967
E's taking him
for a little bit.

1371
01:11:33,969 --> 01:11:36,736
- Edna is babysitting?
- Yeah.

1372
01:11:36,738 --> 01:11:38,806
And you're okay with this?

1373
01:11:38,808 --> 01:11:41,243
Yeah. I don't know why,
but yeah.

1374
01:11:43,145 --> 01:11:45,848
I wanted to say
something to you.

1375
01:11:46,882 --> 01:11:49,283
Sorry about Tony.

1376
01:11:49,285 --> 01:11:52,252
I didn't think about Dicker
erasing his memory...

1377
01:11:52,254 --> 01:11:55,923
or about you having to pay
the price for a choice...

1378
01:11:55,925 --> 01:11:59,860
you never made.
It's not fair, I know.

1379
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:01,929
And then, I made it worse
at the restaurant

1380
01:12:01,931 --> 01:12:03,397
by trying to...

1381
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:05,399
Anyway. Anyway...

1382
01:12:05,401 --> 01:12:07,267
I'm sorry.

1383
01:12:07,269 --> 01:12:08,836
I'm used to knowing

1384
01:12:08,838 --> 01:12:10,736
what the right thing
to do is...

1385
01:12:10,738 --> 01:12:13,907
but now,
I'm not sure anymore.

1386
01:12:13,909 --> 01:12:16,011
I just wanna be...

1387
01:12:18,247 --> 01:12:19,782
a good dad.

1388
01:12:23,419 --> 01:12:25,788
You're not good.

1389
01:12:27,722 --> 01:12:29,191
You're super.

1390
01:12:38,934 --> 01:12:41,902
Are superheroes allowed
to drink on duty?

1391
01:12:41,904 --> 01:12:45,038
I'm definitely not on duty.
Ignore the costume.

1392
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:47,174
I know
I should be up there...

1393
01:12:47,176 --> 01:12:49,376
but I had to step away from
the grip and grins, you know?

1394
01:12:49,378 --> 01:12:52,779
Gotta get away to keep it pure.
I know I do.

1395
01:12:52,781 --> 01:12:54,281
What are you getting
away from?

1396
01:12:54,283 --> 01:12:57,851
Eh, you know, company stuff.
My brother, mostly.

1397
01:12:57,853 --> 01:12:59,853
But you love him,
you two are this company.

1398
01:12:59,855 --> 01:13:01,221
Yin and yang.

1399
01:13:01,223 --> 01:13:03,357
Yeah, I invent the stuff,
he's good at people.

1400
01:13:03,359 --> 01:13:07,895
Pleasing them, engaging them,
figuring out what they want.

1401
01:13:07,897 --> 01:13:10,030
I never know
what people want.

1402
01:13:10,032 --> 01:13:11,867
What do you think
they want?

1403
01:13:12,168 --> 01:13:13,233
Ease.

1404
01:13:13,235 --> 01:13:16,170
People will trade quality
for ease every time.

1405
01:13:16,172 --> 01:13:19,772
It may be crap,
but hey, it's convenient.

1406
01:13:19,774 --> 01:13:21,475
Yeah. Kind of
like this case.

1407
01:13:21,477 --> 01:13:22,809
What?
The Screenslaver?

1408
01:13:22,811 --> 01:13:24,511
Yeah, something's not
sitting right.

1409
01:13:24,513 --> 01:13:26,046
It was too easy.

1410
01:13:26,048 --> 01:13:28,817
That was too easy?
Wow.

1411
01:13:29,418 --> 01:13:31,451
- Funny.
- What?

1412
01:13:31,453 --> 01:13:33,053
Look at that.

1413
01:13:33,055 --> 01:13:37,191
One of Screenslaver's monitors
is tuned into my suit cam.

1414
01:13:37,193 --> 01:13:39,126
What?

1415
01:13:39,128 --> 01:13:41,261
Isn't the suit cam
closed circuit?

1416
01:13:41,263 --> 01:13:42,029
It is.

1417
01:13:42,031 --> 01:13:44,898
Then how come
Screenslaver has it?

1418
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,366
Maybe he hacked it?

1419
01:13:46,368 --> 01:13:49,069
So, he's sophisticated enough
to do that...

1420
01:13:49,071 --> 01:13:51,838
but he has simple locks
on his doors?

1421
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:53,874
Maybe he wanted you
to find him.

1422
01:13:53,876 --> 01:13:55,342
He wanted to get caught?

1423
01:13:55,344 --> 01:13:57,311
He wanted you to win.

1424
01:13:57,313 --> 01:13:59,813
That makes no sense.
He's a brilliant guy.

1425
01:13:59,815 --> 01:14:01,081
If he's smart enough
to conceive

1426
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:02,549
of technology like this...

1427
01:14:02,551 --> 01:14:05,085
he's smart enough to think
of something to do with it.

1428
01:14:05,087 --> 01:14:07,221
The guy we put in jail
delivered pizzas.

1429
01:14:07,223 --> 01:14:08,188
So?

1430
01:14:08,190 --> 01:14:09,990
Einstein was
a patent clerk.

1431
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:12,125
Look, you won.
You got the guy who...

1432
01:14:12,127 --> 01:14:14,494
Wait. All Screenslaver
needs to do

1433
01:14:14,496 --> 01:14:15,896
to hypnotize someone...

1434
01:14:15,898 --> 01:14:17,998
is get a screen
in front of their eyes.

1435
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,171
But what if the screen
doesn't look like a screen?

1436
01:14:24,373 --> 01:14:28,909
What if the pizza guy
is really a pizza guy...

1437
01:14:28,911 --> 01:14:30,210
but he was controlled
by the screens

1438
01:14:30,212 --> 01:14:31,380
built into his glasses...

1439
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:34,883
You are good.

1440
01:14:38,954 --> 01:14:39,987
<i>Look, the robot!</i>

1441
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:41,388
<i>It's taking off.</i>

1442
01:14:41,390 --> 01:14:43,190
<i>I'm not getting
a reading yet.</i>

1443
01:14:43,192 --> 01:14:44,124
- <i>Press "fire"?</i>
- <i>Now!</i>

1444
01:14:47,229 --> 01:14:48,128
<i>More power.</i>

1445
01:14:48,130 --> 01:14:51,098
<i>Oh, I hope
this works, Dad.</i>

1446
01:14:51,100 --> 01:14:54,001
I thought it was best
to just let you sleep.

1447
01:14:54,003 --> 01:14:56,937
Seventeen hours.

1448
01:14:56,939 --> 01:14:59,306
How do you feel?

1449
01:14:59,308 --> 01:15:00,407
Super.

1450
01:15:00,409 --> 01:15:03,377
- <i>You got it, Dad.</i>
- <i>Hurray!</i>

1451
01:15:03,379 --> 01:15:05,412
I can't tell you
how much I appreciate

1452
01:15:05,414 --> 01:15:07,481
you watching
Jack-Jack for me, E.

1453
01:15:07,483 --> 01:15:10,917
Yes, I'm sure your gratitude
is quite inexpressible.

1454
01:15:10,919 --> 01:15:12,552
Don't ask me
to do it again, darling.

1455
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:14,154
My rates are far too high.

1456
01:15:14,156 --> 01:15:15,188
Oh, uh...

1457
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:17,624
I am joking, Robert.
I enjoyed the assignment.

1458
01:15:17,626 --> 01:15:19,559
He is bright
and I am stimulating.

1459
01:15:19,561 --> 01:15:21,595
We deserve each other.

1460
01:15:21,597 --> 01:15:23,964
Your child is a polymorph.

1461
01:15:23,966 --> 01:15:26,300
Like all babies,
he has enormous potential.

1462
01:15:26,302 --> 01:15:28,101
It is not unknown
for supers

1463
01:15:28,103 --> 01:15:29,936
to have more than one
power when young...

1464
01:15:29,938 --> 01:15:32,572
but this little one has many.

1465
01:15:32,574 --> 01:15:35,944
Yes, you have many powers.

1466
01:15:49,358 --> 01:15:51,591
I understand
your lack of sleep

1467
01:15:51,593 --> 01:15:53,060
and coherency, Robert.

1468
01:15:53,062 --> 01:15:54,528
Babies can be anything,

1469
01:15:54,530 --> 01:15:56,196
and your child
is no exception.

1470
01:15:56,198 --> 01:15:59,099
He has pure,
unlimited potential, Robert.

1471
01:15:59,101 --> 01:16:02,169
He slept while I worked
in a creative fever.

1472
01:16:02,171 --> 01:16:04,571
Auntie Edna stayed up
all night...

1473
01:16:04,573 --> 01:16:07,341
making sure you look
fabulous in your many forms.

1474
01:16:07,343 --> 01:16:10,043
What are you... You're
putting him in the...

1475
01:16:10,045 --> 01:16:11,278
In the chamber, Robert.

1476
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,080
He is part
of the demonstration

1477
01:16:13,082 --> 01:16:14,214
and will be fine.

1478
01:16:14,216 --> 01:16:16,216
Your challenge
is to manage a baby

1479
01:16:16,218 --> 01:16:17,984
who has
multiple powers...

1480
01:16:17,986 --> 01:16:21,121
and no control
over them, yes?

1481
01:16:21,123 --> 01:16:22,622
Huh. That sums it up.

1482
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:24,157
I often work to music

1483
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:27,094
and I noticed the baby
responds to it as well.

1484
01:16:27,096 --> 01:16:29,096
Specifically, Mozart.

1485
01:16:29,098 --> 01:16:30,597
I blended Kevlar

1486
01:16:30,599 --> 01:16:32,966
with carbyne for
durability under duress...

1487
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:34,634
and cotton for comfort.

1488
01:16:34,636 --> 01:16:38,205
Interwoven with these fabrics
are a mesh of tiny sensors...

1489
01:16:38,207 --> 01:16:41,274
that monitor the baby's
physical properties.

1490
01:16:41,276 --> 01:16:44,311
Oh, Lord!
What is he doing?

1491
01:16:44,313 --> 01:16:47,381
Well, it's Mozart, Robert.
Can you blame him?

1492
01:16:47,383 --> 01:16:49,683
The important thing is that
the suit and tracker...

1493
01:16:49,685 --> 01:16:51,985
anticipated the change
and alerted you.

1494
01:16:51,987 --> 01:16:53,086
Oh, no. Cookies.

1495
01:16:53,088 --> 01:16:54,588
I gotta get cookies!

1496
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:56,556
You do not need cookies.

1497
01:16:56,558 --> 01:16:57,691
As I learned quite painfully

1498
01:16:57,693 --> 01:16:59,025
last night...

1499
01:16:59,027 --> 01:17:00,594
any solution involving cookies

1500
01:17:00,596 --> 01:17:03,663
will inevitably result
in the demon baby.

1501
01:17:05,567 --> 01:17:07,100
"Combustion imminent"?

1502
01:17:07,102 --> 01:17:08,335
What does that mean?

1503
01:17:09,238 --> 01:17:11,004
It means fire, Robert,

1504
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:13,240
for which the suit
has countermeasures.

1505
01:17:13,242 --> 01:17:16,109
I suggest you extinguish
the baby's flames

1506
01:17:16,111 --> 01:17:18,213
before he trips
the sprinkler system.

1507
01:17:20,149 --> 01:17:21,982
The flame retardant

1508
01:17:21,984 --> 01:17:24,184
is blackberry lavender,
darling.

1509
01:17:24,186 --> 01:17:27,087
Effective, edible,
and delicious.

1510
01:17:27,089 --> 01:17:30,357
Well, what do you know?
That is useful.

1511
01:17:30,359 --> 01:17:33,260
Although, I have doubtlessly
exceeded your expectations

1512
01:17:33,262 --> 01:17:35,262
for a single night's work...

1513
01:17:35,264 --> 01:17:36,563
the suit
and device contain

1514
01:17:36,565 --> 01:17:38,765
a few more features
we need to discuss.

1515
01:17:38,767 --> 01:17:41,368
Thanks again, E,
for everything.

1516
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:43,103
How much
do I owe you for...

1517
01:17:43,105 --> 01:17:46,072
Pish-posh, darling. Your bill
will be covered by my fee...

1518
01:17:46,074 --> 01:17:48,175
for being Mr. Incredible,
Elastigirl,

1519
01:17:48,177 --> 01:17:50,577
and Frozone's
exclusive designer...

1520
01:17:50,579 --> 01:17:53,246
throughout the known universe
and until the end of time.

1521
01:17:53,248 --> 01:17:55,282
But babysitting this one...

1522
01:17:55,284 --> 01:17:58,320
I do for free, darling.

1523
01:18:15,737 --> 01:18:17,070
<i>I would resist</i>

1524
01:18:17,072 --> 01:18:18,371
<i>the temptation to stretch.</i>

1525
01:18:18,373 --> 01:18:21,475
<i>The temperature around you
is well below freezing.</i>

1526
01:18:21,477 --> 01:18:24,244
<i>Try to stretch
and you'll break.</i>

1527
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:27,047
<i>So, you're
the Screenslaver.</i>

1528
01:18:27,049 --> 01:18:29,382
<i>Yes and no.</i>

1529
01:18:29,384 --> 01:18:32,185
Let's say,
I created the character

1530
01:18:32,187 --> 01:18:34,087
and pre-recorded
the messages.

1531
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:35,455
<i>Does Winston know?</i>

1532
01:18:35,457 --> 01:18:38,391
That I'm the Screenslaver?
Of course not.

1533
01:18:38,393 --> 01:18:40,828
Can you imagine
what Mr. Free Enterprise

1534
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:42,629
would do
with my hypnosis technology?

1535
01:18:42,631 --> 01:18:44,297
<i>Worse than
what you're doing?</i>

1536
01:18:44,299 --> 01:18:46,433
<i>Hey, I'm using
the technology</i>

1537
01:18:46,435 --> 01:18:48,268
<i>to destroy
people's trust in it.</i>

1538
01:18:48,270 --> 01:18:50,704
Like I'm using superheroes.

1539
01:18:50,706 --> 01:18:52,272
<i>Who did I put in jail?</i>

1540
01:18:52,274 --> 01:18:53,540
<i>Pizza delivery guy.</i>

1541
01:18:53,542 --> 01:18:55,342
<i>Seemed the right height,
build.</i>

1542
01:18:55,344 --> 01:18:57,644
<i>He gave you
a pretty good fight.</i>

1543
01:18:57,646 --> 01:18:59,246
<i>I should say I gave you</i>

1544
01:18:59,248 --> 01:19:00,614
<i>a pretty good fight
through him.</i>

1545
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:02,382
<i>But it doesn't
bother you</i>

1546
01:19:02,384 --> 01:19:04,284
<i>that an innocent man
is in jail?</i>

1547
01:19:04,286 --> 01:19:07,521
Eh, he was surly
and the pizza was cold.

1548
01:19:07,523 --> 01:19:09,256
I counted on you.

1549
01:19:09,258 --> 01:19:10,690
That's why you failed.

1550
01:19:10,692 --> 01:19:12,259
What?

1551
01:19:12,261 --> 01:19:14,795
<i>Why would you count on me?
Because I built you a bike?</i>

1552
01:19:14,797 --> 01:19:17,297
<i>Because my brother
knows the words</i>

1553
01:19:17,299 --> 01:19:18,398
<i>to your theme song?</i>

1554
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:20,133
<i>We don't know each other.</i>

1555
01:19:20,135 --> 01:19:21,735
But you can
count on me anyway.

1556
01:19:21,737 --> 01:19:23,503
<i>I am supposed to,
aren't I?</i>

1557
01:19:23,505 --> 01:19:26,106
<i>Because you have
some strange abilities</i>

1558
01:19:26,108 --> 01:19:27,340
<i>and a shiny costume...</i>

1559
01:19:27,342 --> 01:19:29,777
<i>the rest of us are supposed
to put our lives</i>

1560
01:19:29,779 --> 01:19:31,812
<i>into your gloved hands.</i>

1561
01:19:31,814 --> 01:19:34,347
<i>That's what
my father believed.</i>

1562
01:19:34,349 --> 01:19:38,118
When our home was broken into,
my mother wanted to hide.

1563
01:19:38,120 --> 01:19:40,420
Begged my father
to use the safe room.

1564
01:19:40,422 --> 01:19:44,825
But Father insisted they call
his superhero friends.

1565
01:19:44,827 --> 01:19:49,629
He died,
pointlessly, stupidly...

1566
01:19:49,631 --> 01:19:52,299
waiting for heroes
to save the day.

1567
01:19:52,301 --> 01:19:53,700
<i>But why would you...</i>

1568
01:19:53,702 --> 01:19:55,370
- <i>Your brother...</i>
- Is a child!

1569
01:19:55,905 --> 01:19:57,571
<i>He remembers the time</i>

1570
01:19:57,573 --> 01:19:59,706
<i>when we had parents
and superheroes.</i>

1571
01:19:59,708 --> 01:20:03,643
<i>So, like a child,
Winston conflates the two.</i>

1572
01:20:03,645 --> 01:20:07,414
<i>Mommy and Daddy went away
because supers went away.</i>

1573
01:20:07,416 --> 01:20:10,183
<i>Our sweet parents
were fools</i>

1574
01:20:10,185 --> 01:20:12,285
<i>to put their lives
in anybody else's hands.</i>

1575
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:14,456
<i>Superheroes keep us weak.</i>

1576
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:16,793
Are you gonna kill me?

1577
01:20:17,626 --> 01:20:18,627
Nah.

1578
01:20:20,662 --> 01:20:22,195
Using you is better.

1579
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:25,198
You're gonna help me make
supers illegal...

1580
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:26,668
forever.

1581
01:20:31,673 --> 01:20:33,342
Dada. Dada.

1582
01:20:34,209 --> 01:20:36,411
Ready?
Laser eyes.

1583
01:20:37,814 --> 01:20:38,879
Stop.

1584
01:20:38,881 --> 01:20:40,313
- Wow!
- Yeah!

1585
01:20:40,315 --> 01:20:41,581
- Yay, Jack-Jack!
- Yeah, baby!

1586
01:20:41,583 --> 01:20:42,850
And that's not all.
Watch this.

1587
01:20:42,852 --> 01:20:44,653
Jack-Jack, blaster ready?

1588
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:51,491
- No way.
- That is crazy cool.

1589
01:20:51,493 --> 01:20:52,793
My turn.
I get to blast him first!

1590
01:20:52,795 --> 01:20:54,194
- Let me try. I want him.
- Give him to me.

1591
01:20:54,196 --> 01:20:55,629
Hey, I'm just demonstrating.

1592
01:20:55,631 --> 01:20:57,631
No firing the baby around
the house, you understand?

1593
01:20:57,633 --> 01:21:00,300
This is potentially
dangerous...

1594
01:21:00,302 --> 01:21:03,436
and we're trying to teach him
to control his powers, okay?

1595
01:21:03,438 --> 01:21:05,307
Stop. See the screen.

1596
01:21:07,309 --> 01:21:09,609
He vanished!
That's really cool!

1597
01:21:10,813 --> 01:21:12,379
Okay, good. Use the thing.

1598
01:21:12,381 --> 01:21:14,280
That's the current readout.
Click it. See the readout?

1599
01:21:14,282 --> 01:21:16,249
Dimension four.
See the shape?

1600
01:21:16,251 --> 01:21:18,218
That's the room.
See where he is in relation?

1601
01:21:18,220 --> 01:21:19,388
So, where is he?

1602
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:23,356
He's... there!

1603
01:21:23,358 --> 01:21:25,394
Okay. Come out.
Num-num cookie?

1604
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:28,595
- Yay, Jack-Jack!
- Yeah, Jack-Jack!

1605
01:21:28,597 --> 01:21:30,532
That's really cool.

1606
01:21:36,772 --> 01:21:39,239
- Hello?
- Elastigirl's in trouble.

1607
01:21:39,241 --> 01:21:40,540
What? What happened to her?

1608
01:21:40,542 --> 01:21:42,242
Sorry to tell you
on the phone.

1609
01:21:42,244 --> 01:21:43,677
Meet me on our ship
at DEVTECH.

1610
01:21:43,679 --> 01:21:45,846
The ship at DEVTECH.
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

1611
01:21:45,848 --> 01:21:48,281
What's at the ship
at DEVTECH?

1612
01:21:48,283 --> 01:21:49,817
Lucius? Bob.
Helen's in trouble.

1613
01:21:49,819 --> 01:21:51,551
I need someone
to watch the kids.

1614
01:21:51,553 --> 01:21:53,253
<i>Suit up. It might get weird.</i>

1615
01:21:53,255 --> 01:21:54,822
I'll be there.
ASAP. Fifteen tops.

1616
01:21:54,824 --> 01:21:56,824
Where are you
going ASAP?

1617
01:21:56,826 --> 01:21:58,458
You better be back ASAP!

1618
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,693
And leaving that suit.

1619
01:21:59,695 --> 01:22:01,494
I gotta go.
I'll be home soon.

1620
01:22:01,496 --> 01:22:02,830
Lucius will be here sooner.

1621
01:22:02,832 --> 01:22:04,999
No firing the baby
around the house, okay?

1622
01:22:05,001 --> 01:22:06,766
What's at the ship
at DEVTECH?

1623
01:22:06,768 --> 01:22:09,304
And why are you
in your Supersuit?

1624
01:22:21,316 --> 01:22:22,716
Is that Mom's supersuit?

1625
01:22:22,718 --> 01:22:24,751
She may need it.
You never know.

1626
01:22:24,753 --> 01:22:26,453
What's going on?

1627
01:22:26,455 --> 01:22:28,455
I don't know,
but Dad called Lucius

1628
01:22:28,457 --> 01:22:30,457
after getting a call
about Mom...

1629
01:22:30,459 --> 01:22:31,725
and then left.

1630
01:22:31,727 --> 01:22:33,493
I thought you renounced
superheroes.

1631
01:22:33,495 --> 01:22:36,730
Yeah, well,
I renounce my renunciation.

1632
01:22:36,732 --> 01:22:37,834
Put that on.

1633
01:22:48,978 --> 01:22:51,711
Hello there, little fella.

1634
01:22:51,713 --> 01:22:53,346
Hello.

1635
01:22:53,348 --> 01:22:54,581
You kids aren't safe.

1636
01:22:54,583 --> 01:22:55,816
The Deavors sent us
to take you...

1637
01:22:55,818 --> 01:22:58,685
Well,
isn't that redundant?

1638
01:22:58,687 --> 01:23:01,656
The Deavors just sent me here
to guard the house.

1639
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,693
'Cause the kids aren't safe.

1640
01:23:06,695 --> 01:23:08,661
I get it,
managerial screw-up.

1641
01:23:08,663 --> 01:23:10,097
Tell Winston
I handled it.

1642
01:23:10,099 --> 01:23:11,765
You understand,
Ms...

1643
01:23:11,767 --> 01:23:13,033
Voyd.

1644
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:14,636
Ms. Voyd.

1645
01:23:15,872 --> 01:23:16,839
Drive safely.

1646
01:23:26,648 --> 01:23:30,683
The thing is, he wants us
to bring you, too.

1647
01:23:30,685 --> 01:23:31,786
Hey.

1648
01:23:33,388 --> 01:23:34,791
That isn't gonna
hold them long.

1649
01:23:35,892 --> 01:23:37,524
Dash, grab the baby!

1650
01:23:40,362 --> 01:23:41,530
Spread out!

1651
01:23:43,665 --> 01:23:44,697
- Whoa!
- Oh!

1652
01:23:44,699 --> 01:23:46,601
Dash!

1653
01:23:47,402 --> 01:23:48,805
We gotta get to my car.

1654
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,147
What? What's going on?

1655
01:24:00,149 --> 01:24:01,550
Little fella!

1656
01:24:20,002 --> 01:24:21,668
It worked!

1657
01:24:27,409 --> 01:24:28,945
Incredibile, windows down!

1658
01:24:30,813 --> 01:24:31,814
Dive in!

1659
01:24:38,520 --> 01:24:40,988
Incredibile,
set voice identification.

1660
01:24:40,990 --> 01:24:42,522
Loudly, say your names.

1661
01:24:42,524 --> 01:24:45,793
- Violet Parr.
- Dashiell Robert Parr.

1662
01:24:49,764 --> 01:24:50,831
Lucius!

1663
01:24:50,833 --> 01:24:52,869
Incredibile, escape!

1664
01:25:01,110 --> 01:25:02,609
Fill me in!

1665
01:25:02,611 --> 01:25:04,510
Good news and bad news.
We found her.

1666
01:25:04,512 --> 01:25:05,880
She seems physically fine

1667
01:25:05,882 --> 01:25:07,580
but she's had an encounter
with Screenslaver...

1668
01:25:07,582 --> 01:25:09,886
and she's acting
kind of strange. In here.

1669
01:25:13,622 --> 01:25:14,889
Strange how?

1670
01:25:23,165 --> 01:25:24,499
Helen?

1671
01:25:25,134 --> 01:25:26,836
Helen, what are you...

1672
01:25:35,510 --> 01:25:37,044
Helen, it's me.

1673
01:25:53,728 --> 01:25:55,798
Incredibile, pull over.

1674
01:26:00,269 --> 01:26:03,203
We can't go to E's.

1675
01:26:03,205 --> 01:26:05,772
You saw those goggles
they put on Lucius.

1676
01:26:05,774 --> 01:26:07,740
They were
wearing them, too.

1677
01:26:07,742 --> 01:26:10,576
They're all under
someone's control.

1678
01:26:10,578 --> 01:26:13,082
They've probably done
the same to Mom.

1679
01:26:14,582 --> 01:26:16,749
Okay. Bad guys after us.

1680
01:26:16,751 --> 01:26:18,551
No Mom, no Dad.

1681
01:26:18,553 --> 01:26:19,752
No Lucius.

1682
01:26:19,754 --> 01:26:23,591
But we have our powers,
this car...

1683
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:27,828
and... what?

1684
01:26:39,875 --> 01:26:42,778
Incredibile,
take us to DEVTECH.

1685
01:26:45,948 --> 01:26:48,315
<i>The kids have escaped
in a tricked-out car,</i>

1686
01:26:48,317 --> 01:26:49,850
<i>but we got Frozone.</i>

1687
01:26:49,852 --> 01:26:52,855
Bring him to the ship
at DEVTECH immediately.

1688
01:26:58,194 --> 01:27:00,294
Aw, we missed 'em!

1689
01:27:00,296 --> 01:27:04,900
Oh, I wish the Incredibile
could follow that boat.

1690
01:27:07,602 --> 01:27:09,136
- What did you do?
- I don't know.

1691
01:27:09,138 --> 01:27:12,106
- What did you do?
- I didn't do anything!

1692
01:27:19,748 --> 01:27:22,952
Wow, this car does
anything I say.

1693
01:27:30,625 --> 01:27:32,359
We didn't plan this well.

1694
01:27:32,361 --> 01:27:34,028
What do you mean?
We're here, aren't we?

1695
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:35,628
Yes, we're here.

1696
01:27:35,630 --> 01:27:38,034
We need to be up there.

1697
01:27:39,001 --> 01:27:40,167
Hey...

1698
01:27:40,169 --> 01:27:44,637
What if the Incredibile
has ejector seats?

1699
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,040
Wait, what? No.

1700
01:27:46,042 --> 01:27:47,775
- Yeah, baby!
- No, don't say any more...

1701
01:27:47,777 --> 01:27:49,243
Max power! Launch!

1702
01:27:56,718 --> 01:27:58,684
Come on.

1703
01:28:01,223 --> 01:28:02,890
Hello!
Glad you could come.

1704
01:28:02,892 --> 01:28:04,860
Welcome to the conference.

1705
01:28:15,204 --> 01:28:17,004
Our stars, where are they?

1706
01:28:17,006 --> 01:28:18,305
<i>The event's about to start.</i>

1707
01:28:18,307 --> 01:28:20,340
They didn't want to upstage
the others.

1708
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:22,843
<i>They'll join for the signing.</i>

1709
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:25,345
Welcome, guests!
You're in for a treat.

1710
01:28:25,347 --> 01:28:29,983
This ship is the largest
hydrofoil on the planet.

1711
01:28:29,985 --> 01:28:31,118
So, hold onto something...

1712
01:28:31,120 --> 01:28:33,923
because we're going
to open her up!

1713
01:28:52,108 --> 01:28:54,775
We need to find Mom and Dad.
Stay here.

1714
01:28:54,777 --> 01:28:55,976
I'm gonna search for them.

1715
01:28:55,978 --> 01:28:58,412
Wait! Who's gonna
watch Jack-Jack?

1716
01:28:58,414 --> 01:29:00,447
Suck it up.
I won't be long.

1717
01:29:00,449 --> 01:29:03,117
Wait. Wait, but, but wait!

1718
01:29:03,119 --> 01:29:05,919
This is important.
They are in trouble.

1719
01:29:05,921 --> 01:29:08,856
It's up to us.
To us, understand?

1720
01:29:08,858 --> 01:29:11,759
Keep him amused but quiet!

1721
01:29:12,962 --> 01:29:13,996
Ugh.

1722
01:29:23,806 --> 01:29:25,841
Shh! Quiet!

1723
01:29:26,741 --> 01:29:27,910
Huh?

1724
01:29:32,148 --> 01:29:33,149
Jack-Jack?

1725
01:29:42,992 --> 01:29:45,027
Jack-Jack?
Jack-Jack!

1726
01:30:18,294 --> 01:30:19,159
Jack-Jack!

1727
01:30:19,161 --> 01:30:21,061
The mesmerized supers
know we're here...

1728
01:30:21,063 --> 01:30:24,031
but I found Mom and Dad...
Where's Jack-Jack?

1729
01:30:24,033 --> 01:30:27,201
You lost him?
I gave you one thing to do!

1730
01:30:27,203 --> 01:30:28,971
The tracker.
Use the tracker.

1731
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:34,074
He's going up?

1732
01:30:34,076 --> 01:30:36,245
- He's in an elevator.
- Let's go!

1733
01:30:38,180 --> 01:30:40,847
Hey, little baby.
Where are your parents?

1734
01:30:43,385 --> 01:30:45,352
And here they are, folks!

1735
01:30:45,354 --> 01:30:48,255
The supers who started
this whole thing.

1736
01:30:48,257 --> 01:30:50,257
<i>I told you
they'd be there in time.</i>

1737
01:30:50,259 --> 01:30:52,960
Hey, did you make them
new masks?

1738
01:30:52,962 --> 01:30:54,928
Yeah. Night vision,
et cetera...

1739
01:30:54,930 --> 01:30:56,296
They look good, right?

1740
01:30:56,298 --> 01:30:58,065
<i>So simple,
even he can do it.</i>

1741
01:30:58,067 --> 01:31:02,069
And we're back live in
three, two, one...

1742
01:31:02,071 --> 01:31:03,837
This is
a momentous occasion.

1743
01:31:03,839 --> 01:31:05,472
We've all managed
to accomplish

1744
01:31:05,474 --> 01:31:08,976
something extraordinarily rare
in today's world.

1745
01:31:08,978 --> 01:31:10,844
We agree on something.

1746
01:31:13,916 --> 01:31:17,017
<i>We agree to undo
a bad decision.</i>

1747
01:31:17,019 --> 01:31:18,318
<i>To make sure</i>

1748
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,220
<i>a few extraordinarily
gifted members...</i>

1749
01:31:20,222 --> 01:31:23,023
<i>of the world's many countries
are treated fairly.</i>

1750
01:31:23,025 --> 01:31:26,393
<i>To invite them once again
to use their gifts...</i>

1751
01:31:26,395 --> 01:31:27,894
<i>to benefit the world.</i>

1752
01:31:27,896 --> 01:31:29,396
I thank all of you

1753
01:31:29,398 --> 01:31:32,266
for representing your nation's
commitment to superheroes.

1754
01:31:32,268 --> 01:31:34,835
With special thanks
to Ambassador Selick.

1755
01:31:34,837 --> 01:31:36,536
Yeah, it's okay.
Let her hear you.

1756
01:31:36,538 --> 01:31:38,005
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1757
01:31:38,007 --> 01:31:39,306
Thank you,
Ambassador,

1758
01:31:39,308 --> 01:31:41,441
for your early
and very crucial support.

1759
01:31:41,443 --> 01:31:44,177
I can't think of anyone
more deserving than you...

1760
01:31:44,179 --> 01:31:46,013
to be the first signature

1761
01:31:46,015 --> 01:31:49,151
on the International
Superhero Accord.

1762
01:31:50,185 --> 01:31:52,288
There it is!

1763
01:32:06,001 --> 01:32:07,901
Holy cow!

1764
01:32:07,903 --> 01:32:10,272
I know he's on fire.
Just put him out.

1765
01:32:16,912 --> 01:32:18,914
They're coming.

1766
01:32:28,123 --> 01:32:29,589
Is it okay
to give him that?

1767
01:32:29,591 --> 01:32:32,559
I wasn't hearing
any better ideas.

1768
01:32:56,618 --> 01:32:58,352
No!

1769
01:32:58,354 --> 01:33:00,087
Come on, Jack-Jack.

1770
01:33:00,089 --> 01:33:01,355
We have to go.

1771
01:33:01,357 --> 01:33:02,491
Cookie num-num?

1772
01:33:15,104 --> 01:33:17,938
- Mama, Mama.
- I see him. He's getting away!

1773
01:33:17,940 --> 01:33:19,241
Stand back.

1774
01:33:23,145 --> 01:33:25,314
- Darn it!
- He's heading for Mom.

1775
01:33:27,683 --> 01:33:31,118
It is done.
The world is super again.

1776
01:33:36,392 --> 01:33:39,059
Group photo. Come on.
Group photo, everyone.

1777
01:33:39,061 --> 01:33:41,995
Squeeze in. That's it.
Historic occasion.

1778
01:33:41,997 --> 01:33:43,465
Everyone, smile.

1779
01:33:50,139 --> 01:33:52,105
Go on phase two.

1780
01:33:52,107 --> 01:33:54,508
<i>Years of mandated
hiding and silence</i>

1781
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:56,143
have made us bitter.

1782
01:33:56,145 --> 01:33:58,011
You bring us out
into the light...

1783
01:33:58,013 --> 01:33:59,312
<i>only to clean up the messes</i>

1784
01:33:59,314 --> 01:34:01,381
<i>your lack
of discipline creates.</i>

1785
01:34:01,383 --> 01:34:04,017
<i>Your bodies
and your character are weak.</i>

1786
01:34:04,019 --> 01:34:07,687
<i>Your promises are empty,
and you will pay for it.</i>

1787
01:34:07,689 --> 01:34:09,556
<i>We no longer serve you.</i>

1788
01:34:09,558 --> 01:34:11,158
<i>We serve only us.</i>

1789
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,195
<i>May the fittest survive.</i>

1790
01:34:15,564 --> 01:34:16,596
<i>Well, we, um...</i>

1791
01:34:16,598 --> 01:34:19,366
<i>Some very alarming
moments there...</i>

1792
01:34:19,368 --> 01:34:22,169
<i>before the, uh,
technical difficulties.</i>

1793
01:34:22,171 --> 01:34:23,572
<i>Please bear with us.</i>

1794
01:34:36,585 --> 01:34:38,251
What?

1795
01:34:38,253 --> 01:34:39,753
Mayday! Mayday!
Mayday!

1796
01:34:39,755 --> 01:34:41,321
Hold! Let him talk.

1797
01:34:41,323 --> 01:34:43,323
Superheroes have forcibly
taken the bridge. Repeat.

1798
01:34:43,325 --> 01:34:44,191
Now.

1799
01:34:55,504 --> 01:34:57,103
A little further.

1800
01:34:57,105 --> 01:34:59,141
<i>Little further. Stop.</i>

1801
01:35:04,713 --> 01:35:07,280
What the... A baby?

1802
01:35:07,282 --> 01:35:09,318
Mom and Dad.
Uncle Lucius?

1803
01:35:11,753 --> 01:35:13,487
- My mama.
- Jack-Jack, no!

1804
01:35:16,525 --> 01:35:18,360
A super baby?

1805
01:35:23,198 --> 01:35:24,631
No, no, no!

1806
01:35:24,633 --> 01:35:25,634
<i>Put him down!</i>

1807
01:35:27,436 --> 01:35:29,102
- Grab her!
- No!

1808
01:35:29,104 --> 01:35:30,272
Hold Jack-Jack.

1809
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,413
No!

1810
01:35:40,415 --> 01:35:42,282
Hey, it's me!

1811
01:35:42,284 --> 01:35:43,683
Yeah, that's what
I thought last time.

1812
01:35:43,685 --> 01:35:46,588
Kids, what are you...

1813
01:35:48,190 --> 01:35:50,791
You came for us?

1814
01:35:50,793 --> 01:35:52,158
Don't be mad.

1815
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,630
Oh, sweetie,
how could I be mad?

1816
01:35:55,531 --> 01:35:57,832
I'm proud.

1817
01:35:57,834 --> 01:35:59,699
Not to break up
a tender moment,

1818
01:35:59,701 --> 01:36:01,201
but where are we?

1819
01:36:01,203 --> 01:36:02,669
Is this DEVTECH's ship?

1820
01:36:02,671 --> 01:36:04,671
Evelyn Deavor
controls the Screenslaver...

1821
01:36:04,673 --> 01:36:07,474
and until a second ago, us.

1822
01:36:07,476 --> 01:36:09,543
Where's the crew?

1823
01:36:09,545 --> 01:36:11,745
<i>Collision detected.
Correct course.</i>

1824
01:36:11,747 --> 01:36:13,146
Uh-oh.
Did I do that?

1825
01:36:13,148 --> 01:36:16,351
Mom, the suit?
Try this.

1826
01:36:18,554 --> 01:36:21,223
Phase Three.
Go on Phase Three!

1827
01:36:24,393 --> 01:36:26,760
Why are the kids here?
You didn't go to the house?

1828
01:36:26,762 --> 01:36:28,161
I went to the house.

1829
01:36:28,163 --> 01:36:29,529
You didn't escape?
How did you not escape?

1830
01:36:29,531 --> 01:36:31,731
Hey!
We just saved you!

1831
01:36:31,733 --> 01:36:33,801
Escape? Escape from who?

1832
01:36:36,705 --> 01:36:37,739
Those guys!

1833
01:36:40,442 --> 01:36:43,176
What the...?
Jack-Jack has powers?

1834
01:36:43,178 --> 01:36:45,312
We know.
Fight now, talk later.

1835
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:20,213
Jack-Jack.

1836
01:37:20,215 --> 01:37:21,548
Laser eyes!

1837
01:37:31,326 --> 01:37:32,525
Ah-ha!

1838
01:37:43,238 --> 01:37:44,439
Ugh.

1839
01:37:49,378 --> 01:37:51,411
Come with me, Winston.

1840
01:37:51,413 --> 01:37:53,380
- Did I faint?
- You'll be safe here.

1841
01:37:53,382 --> 01:37:55,384
Safe? Safe from what?

1842
01:37:56,485 --> 01:37:58,752
Where are the diplomats?
The supers?

1843
01:37:58,754 --> 01:37:59,887
Still hypnotized.

1844
01:37:59,889 --> 01:38:02,391
What have you done?

1845
01:38:06,528 --> 01:38:08,728
Evelyn, she's escaping.

1846
01:38:08,730 --> 01:38:09,763
Well, go after her.

1847
01:38:09,765 --> 01:38:10,563
Finish your mission.

1848
01:38:10,565 --> 01:38:13,266
I can't just go!
What about the kids?

1849
01:38:13,268 --> 01:38:15,870
- Jack-Jack, who's gonna...
- Mom!

1850
01:38:15,872 --> 01:38:17,739
Go. We've got this.

1851
01:38:19,508 --> 01:38:21,408
Voyd, come with me.

1852
01:38:21,410 --> 01:38:22,810
I'll go shut down
the engine.

1853
01:38:22,812 --> 01:38:24,477
I'll try to slow the
ship from the bow.

1854
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:27,414
Wait, someone's missing.
Where's the crusher guy?

1855
01:38:27,416 --> 01:38:29,284
Strap in now!

1856
01:38:44,633 --> 01:38:46,301
It's for your own good.

1857
01:38:46,601 --> 01:38:48,301
No!

1858
01:38:48,303 --> 01:38:49,636
This is.

1859
01:39:00,716 --> 01:39:03,351
- We're too late.
- Get me up to the jet.

1860
01:39:27,309 --> 01:39:30,044
Hey, you did this.
Can you undo it?

1861
01:39:30,046 --> 01:39:32,378
You want me to un-crush?

1862
01:39:32,380 --> 01:39:34,014
What? No one's ever
asked for that?

1863
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:37,017
No. To un-crush is silly.
Why un-crush?

1864
01:39:37,019 --> 01:39:38,618
To get into the engine room.

1865
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:39,854
Oh, forget it.
We don't have enough time.

1866
01:39:39,856 --> 01:39:42,422
What if I said
to un-punch someone?

1867
01:39:42,424 --> 01:39:43,592
What do you do?

1868
01:39:47,329 --> 01:39:48,863
Welcome aboard, Elastigirl.

1869
01:39:48,865 --> 01:39:50,563
<i>Although
we haven't yet reached</i>

1870
01:39:50,565 --> 01:39:51,901
<i>our cruising altitude...</i>

1871
01:39:53,435 --> 01:39:55,803
feel free to roam about
the cabin.

1872
01:39:55,805 --> 01:39:58,471
Or just relax...

1873
01:39:58,473 --> 01:40:01,443
<i>and let the cabin roam
about you.</i>

1874
01:40:10,385 --> 01:40:12,385
I can't get
to the engine room!

1875
01:40:12,387 --> 01:40:13,788
We gotta do something!

1876
01:40:13,790 --> 01:40:15,455
Because trying to
slow it down ain't working.

1877
01:40:15,457 --> 01:40:17,390
Hey! What about
turning the boat?

1878
01:40:17,392 --> 01:40:18,591
The steering's
been destroyed!

1879
01:40:18,593 --> 01:40:21,394
- Dash means from the outside!
- Yeah!

1880
01:40:21,396 --> 01:40:22,495
If we break off
one of the foils

1881
01:40:22,497 --> 01:40:23,663
and turn the rudder...

1882
01:40:23,665 --> 01:40:26,033
we can veer the ship
away from the city!

1883
01:40:26,035 --> 01:40:27,500
That might work.

1884
01:40:27,502 --> 01:40:28,635
I'll turn the front,
you turn the rear.

1885
01:40:28,637 --> 01:40:30,737
Using the rudder?
That's underwater.

1886
01:40:30,739 --> 01:40:32,006
How am I supposed to get...

1887
01:40:32,008 --> 01:40:33,908
All right.
Come on, kids.

1888
01:40:33,910 --> 01:40:36,944
Dad, I know
this is going to work.

1889
01:40:36,946 --> 01:40:39,479
But if it doesn't,
and we crash...

1890
01:40:39,481 --> 01:40:42,883
my shields are probably better
protection than the ship.

1891
01:40:42,885 --> 01:40:46,555
I should stay here.
With Jack-Jack.

1892
01:40:47,089 --> 01:40:48,588
That's my girl.

1893
01:40:48,590 --> 01:40:51,027
Remember, Bob,
we're both turning right!

1894
01:40:57,699 --> 01:40:59,701
You know what's sad?

1895
01:41:02,972 --> 01:41:04,872
If it weren't
for your core beliefs...

1896
01:41:04,874 --> 01:41:07,609
I think we could have
been good friends.

1897
01:41:08,610 --> 01:41:10,579
At least...

1898
01:41:11,513 --> 01:41:13,548
I have core beliefs.

1899
01:41:14,984 --> 01:41:16,449
<i>We have breaking news...</i>

1900
01:41:16,451 --> 01:41:18,585
<i>While there is
still no radio contact,</i>

1901
01:41:18,587 --> 01:41:20,120
<i>the ship
has changed direction...</i>

1902
01:41:20,122 --> 01:41:21,421
<i>and is heading towards land</i>

1903
01:41:21,423 --> 01:41:22,792
<i>at a high rate of speed.</i>

1904
01:41:27,063 --> 01:41:28,597
So, Dash...

1905
01:41:29,731 --> 01:41:31,198
I am going to the rudder.

1906
01:41:31,200 --> 01:41:34,500
Once I turn the ship,
you hit the pull up button.

1907
01:41:34,502 --> 01:41:36,469
- Okay, Dad.
- Now lower me down...

1908
01:41:40,609 --> 01:41:43,911
The reputations of
superheroes are ruined.

1909
01:41:43,913 --> 01:41:47,482
You will never
become legal. Ever.

1910
01:41:47,850 --> 01:41:49,083
Never?

1911
01:41:49,085 --> 01:41:50,650
No.

1912
01:41:50,652 --> 01:41:52,719
- Ever?
- No.

1913
01:41:52,721 --> 01:41:56,023
Not even a little
smidgee-widgee?

1914
01:41:56,025 --> 01:41:57,490
Oh, hypoxia.

1915
01:41:57,492 --> 01:41:59,126
When you don't have
enough oxygen,

1916
01:41:59,128 --> 01:42:01,496
things seem really silly.

1917
01:42:07,736 --> 01:42:09,803
Things get sillier

1918
01:42:09,805 --> 01:42:11,906
and sillier
and then you die.

1919
01:42:11,908 --> 01:42:13,874
I don't wanna die.

1920
01:42:13,876 --> 01:42:15,811
Ah, nobody does.

1921
01:42:16,578 --> 01:42:17,811
Really.

1922
01:42:17,813 --> 01:42:20,049
Not such
a bad way to go.

1923
01:42:38,868 --> 01:42:40,968
Everyone, we need to get
to the back of the ship.

1924
01:42:40,970 --> 01:42:43,705
All supers,
protect your ambassadors!

1925
01:42:44,539 --> 01:42:45,908
Follow.

1926
01:42:48,878 --> 01:42:51,078
Dad's been underwater
for too long.

1927
01:42:59,121 --> 01:43:00,753
We gotta pull him up.

1928
01:43:00,755 --> 01:43:02,158
Wait. It's too soon.

1929
01:43:16,238 --> 01:43:17,871
I'm gonna press the button!

1930
01:43:17,873 --> 01:43:18,874
Not yet!

1931
01:43:33,755 --> 01:43:35,724
It's turning. It's working.

1932
01:43:39,295 --> 01:43:41,629
- Now!
- Dash, now!

1933
01:43:44,599 --> 01:43:46,002
Save yourself. Make a chute.

1934
01:43:48,304 --> 01:43:50,337
Make a chute. Make a chute.

1935
01:43:50,339 --> 01:43:51,872
Make a chute!

1936
01:43:54,076 --> 01:43:56,112
Helen!
Brace yourselves!

1937
01:44:04,253 --> 01:44:05,988
Crash positions!

1938
01:44:24,606 --> 01:44:25,839
Whoo.

1939
01:44:25,841 --> 01:44:29,145
I missed
Jack-Jack's first power?

1940
01:44:30,046 --> 01:44:32,678
Actually, you missed
the first 17.

1941
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:34,281
Oh!

1942
01:44:46,028 --> 01:44:50,696
The fact that you saved me
doesn't make you right.

1943
01:44:50,698 --> 01:44:52,665
But it does make you alive.

1944
01:44:52,667 --> 01:44:54,634
And I'm grateful
for that.

1945
01:44:54,636 --> 01:44:57,670
I'm sorry,
but she'll go to prison.

1946
01:44:57,672 --> 01:44:59,306
Well, I'm sorry she's rich

1947
01:44:59,308 --> 01:45:01,674
and will probably get no more
than a slap on the wrist.

1948
01:45:01,676 --> 01:45:04,278
First of all, Violet,
I like you.

1949
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:07,147
And who knows what the
future may bring...

1950
01:45:07,149 --> 01:45:10,918
but I have a good feeling
about all of you.

1951
01:45:10,920 --> 01:45:12,386
Hmm. Good feeling.

1952
01:45:12,388 --> 01:45:14,154
Should we be worried?

1953
01:45:14,156 --> 01:45:16,924
You guys got the next shift.
I'm beat. Oh!

1954
01:45:16,926 --> 01:45:18,892
I saw what you did back there.
That was incredible!

1955
01:45:18,894 --> 01:45:20,127
No pun intended.

1956
01:45:20,129 --> 01:45:21,862
Sorry I had
to punch you.

1957
01:45:23,432 --> 01:45:26,969
Yeah, baby! My sweet ride!

1958
01:45:39,115 --> 01:45:42,748
And in recognition
of the extraordinary service

1959
01:45:42,750 --> 01:45:43,951
they have demonstrated...

1960
01:45:43,953 --> 01:45:46,420
the legal status
of superheroes

1961
01:45:46,422 --> 01:45:48,754
is hereby restored.

1962
01:45:57,732 --> 01:45:59,732
You don't know me,
do you?

1963
01:45:59,734 --> 01:46:01,101
No, I don't...

1964
01:46:01,103 --> 01:46:02,269
Wait.

1965
01:46:02,271 --> 01:46:04,371
Are you the girl
with the water?

1966
01:46:04,373 --> 01:46:06,874
I'm Violet Parr.

1967
01:46:06,876 --> 01:46:08,408
- I'm Tony.
- Okay.

1968
01:46:08,410 --> 01:46:11,113
You split up into separate
groups and stuff...

1969
01:46:19,355 --> 01:46:20,753
Tony, this is my mom.

1970
01:46:20,755 --> 01:46:21,955
Pleased to meet you.

1971
01:46:21,957 --> 01:46:23,991
- This is my dad.
- Oh, we've met.

1972
01:46:23,993 --> 01:46:26,059
And this is embarrassing.

1973
01:46:26,061 --> 01:46:27,327
Charmed, I'm sure.

1974
01:46:27,329 --> 01:46:29,496
My little brother, Dash.

1975
01:46:29,498 --> 01:46:31,731
And the baby
is Jack-Jack.

1976
01:46:31,733 --> 01:46:34,767
I tried to limit it
to one parent.

1977
01:46:34,769 --> 01:46:37,437
We're all going to a movie,
too, Tony. Don't mind us.

1978
01:46:37,439 --> 01:46:38,738
We'll be sitting

1979
01:46:38,740 --> 01:46:39,907
on the other side
of the theater.

1980
01:46:39,909 --> 01:46:41,441
Not watching you.

1981
01:46:41,443 --> 01:46:43,377
He's kidding.

1982
01:46:43,379 --> 01:46:46,480
They are only dropping
us off at the theater.

1983
01:46:46,482 --> 01:46:49,216
They have
other things to do.

1984
01:46:49,218 --> 01:46:51,952
So, you guys are close,
I guess.

1985
01:46:51,954 --> 01:46:54,321
- Yeah, I guess.
- We can get closer.

1986
01:46:54,323 --> 01:46:55,822
Bob.

1987
01:47:10,339 --> 01:47:11,505
Stop! Let us out!

1988
01:47:11,507 --> 01:47:13,173
Here, large popcorn,
small soda.

1989
01:47:13,175 --> 01:47:15,909
Save me a seat, center,
about eight rows back.

1990
01:47:15,911 --> 01:47:19,014
I'll be back before
the previews are over.

1991
