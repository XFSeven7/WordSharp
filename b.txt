do you ever look at
someone and wonder
what is going on
inside their head
well  i know
well  i know riley's head
and there she was
hello
  riley
  whoa  look at you
aren't you a little bundle of joy
aren't you a little bundle of joy
font color " efeb9a" whoa   font
it was amazing
just riley and me
forever
or for
33 seconds
i'm sadness
oh  hello
i'm joy  so
can i just
if you could
i don't know  let me fix that
thanks
and that was just the beginning
headquarters only got
more crowded from there
very nice  okay
looks like you got this
very good
oh  sharp  sharp
no  look out
that's fear
he's really good at keeping riley safe
easy
easy
fall back
oh  we're good
we're good
  woo  good job
  thank you  thank you very much
and
we're back
whoa
here we go  alright
open
  hm  this looks new
  think it's safe
  what is it
  ah
okay  caution
there is a dangerous smell people
hold on
what is that
this is disgust
she basically keeps riley from being poison
physically and socially
that is not brightly colored
or shaped like a dinosaur
hold on guys
it's broccoli
blah
yucky
well  i just saved our lives
yeah
you're welcome
riley  if you don't eat your dinner
you're not going to get any dessert
wait  did he just say
we couldn't have dessert
that's anger
he
cares very deeply about
things being fair
so  that's how you
want to play it  old man
no dessert  oh  sure
we'll eat our dinner
right after you
eat this
arh
riley  riley
here comes an airplane
oh  airplane
we got an airplane  everybody
  oh
  oh
and
you met sadness
she
well  she
i'm not actually
sure what she does
and i've checked
there's no place for her to go  so
she's good  we're good
it's all great
anyway
these are riley's memories
and they are mostly happy if you noticed
not to brag
but the really important
ones are over here
i don't want to get too technical
but these are called
core memories
each one came from a super
important time in riley's life
like when she first scored a goal
it was so amazing
hey hey
would you look at that
  very nice
  nice job
  woo hoo
  yeah
and each core memory powers
a different aspect of riley's personality
like
hockey island
goofball island
is my personal favorite
come back here
you little monkey
yup
goofball is the best
friendship island is pretty good too
oh
i love honesty island
and that's the truth
and of course
family island is amazing
the point is  the islands are personality
are what make riley  riley
look out
blue face
lava

bing bong  bing bong
hey  very nice
  agh
  brain freeze

down to long term

we did not die today
i call that an
unqualified success
and  that's it
we love our girl
she's got great friends
and a great house
things couldn't be better
after all
riley is 11 now
what could happen
font color " ff8080"  sold   font

  aw
  huh

okay
not what i had in mind
aw
hey  look  the golden gate bridge
isn't that great
it's not made up of solid gold like we thought
which is kind of disappointed  but still
i sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth  joy
  otherwise i be terrified right now
  uh    yeah
these are my kind of people
alright  just a few more blocks
  we're almost to our new house
  step on it  daddy
why can't we just live in the smelly car
we're already been in it forever
which
actually was really lucky
because that gave us plenty of time to think
about what our new house is going to look like
what  let's review
the top 5 daydreams
  woo  that looks safe
  that looks nice
oh  this will be great for riley
oh  no  no  no    this one
joy for the last time
she cannot live in a cookie
that's the one
it comes with a dragon
are we getting close
i can feel it
here it is
here's our new house
and
maybe  it's nice on the inside
  we're suppose to live here
  do we have to
i'm telling you  it smells
that something died in here
  can you die from moving
  guys  you are overreacting
  nobody is dieing
  a dead mouse
  great
  i'm gonna be sick
it's a house of the dead
what're we gonna do
  we're gonna get rabies
  get off from me
hey  hey  hey
all through the drive
dad talked about how cool
our new room is
  let's go check it out
  it's gonna be great
yes  yes  yes  yes
  no  no  no
  i'm starting to envy the dead mouse
get out the rubber ball
we're in solitary confinement
  riley can't live here
  she's right
  it's the worst
  really bad
  it's absolutely the worst
  this house stinks
  it's the worst place
      i've been in my entire life
  oh  yeah
hey  it's nothing our
butterfly curtains couldn't fix
i read somewhere that an
empty room is an opportunity
where did you read that
it doesn't matter
i read it and it's great
we'll put the bed there
and the desk over there
the hock lamp goes there
  put the chair there
  or the trophy collections
  there
  stars
  i like that
  now  we're talking
let's go get our stuff
from the moving van
alright  goodbye
well  guess what
the moving van won't
be here until thursday
your kidding
our van is lost
it's the worst day ever
  you said it would be here yesterday
  and i know that's what i said
  that's what they told me
  mom and dad are stress out
  they are stress out
  arguing
  what're we going to do
i've got a great idea
did you even read the contract
anderson makes her move
she's closing in
hey
oh no  you're not
  she's running for the shot
  coming behind you  watch out
and she scores
yeah
  woo hoo

you're the best  thanks hon
see you  sweetie
dad just left us
oh  he doesn't love us anymore
that's sad
i should drive  right
joy
what are you doing
just you
give me 1 second
you know what i've realised
riley hasn't had lunch  remember
hey  i saw a pizza place down the street
maybe we can try that
  pizza sounds delicious
  pizza
  yeah  pizza
  pizza  great idea  let's get it
  what the heck is that
  who puts broccoli on pizza
that's it
i'm done
congratulation san francisco
you ruined pizza
first the hawaiians
and now you
what kind of a pizza place
only serves 1 kind of pizza
must be a san francisco thing
still  it's not as bad as the soup
at that diner in nebraska
oh  yeah  the spoon stood up
in the soup by itself
that was disgusting
we're good
family's running
the drive out was pretty fun
what was your favorite part
spitting out of the car window
  definitely not when dad was singing
  wearing the sit belt
oh  what about the time
with the dinosaur
  oh  that's the one
  that was great
say cheese
  dad  dad  dad
  honey
dad  look at the car
just look behind you
no no no
no
ah
nice one  joy
i like that time with the dinosaur
that was pretty funny
wait  what
what happened
she did something to the memory
  what did you do
  i  i just touched it
  that shouldn't make it change
  oh  change it back  joy
  i'm trying
  you can't change it back
  no  i guess i can't
  good going  sadness
now when riley thinks of that moment with dad
she's gonna feel sad  bravo
i'm sorry  joy  i don't really know
i thought maybe if you  if you  i mean
joy
we got a stairway coming up
just don't touch any other memories
until we figured out what's going on
  okay
  alright
get ready  this is the monster railing
and we are riding it all the way down
wait  what
what happened
  a core memory
  oh no
  sadness  what're you doing
  it looked like one was crooked
so i opened it and it fell out
i
woo hoo
it's just that  i want to
maybe  hold one
  joy
  whoa  whoa  whoa  whoa
sadness  you nearly
touch a core memory
and when you touch them
we can't change them back
oh  i know  i'm sorry
something's wrong with me
i    it's like
i'm having a break down
you're not having a break down
it's stress
i keep making mistakes like that
i'm awful
  no  you're not
  and annoying
they  well
you know what
you can't focus on
what's going wrong
there's always a way
to turn things around
to find the fun
yeah  find the fun
i don't know how to do that
okay  well
try to think of something funny
oh  remember the funny movie
where the dog dies
oh  yeah
that's not    oh
what about that time  with mag
when riley laughed so hard
milk came out of her nose
come on
yeah  that hurts
it felt like fire
  it was awf
  okay  okay
don't think of that
let's try something else
  what're your favorite things to do
  my favorite
well  i like it
when we're outside
that's good  like  there's
the beach and sunshine
oh  like the time we buried
dad in the sand up to his neck
i was thinking more like rain
rain
rain is my favorite too
we can stomp around the puddles
you know
there's cool umbrellas  lightning storms
more like when the rain runs down our back
and makes our shoe soggy
and we get all cold  shivery and
everything starts feeling droopy
oh  hey  hey  hey
easy
why are you crying
it's    it's really the opposite
of what we're going for here
crying helps me slow down and not
obsessive with the way of life's problems
you know what
let's think about something else
how about we read some mind manuals
sounds fun
i've read most of them
well  have you read this one
this seem interesting
long term memory retrieval
volume 47
  no
  woo  a real page turner
long term memory data selection
via channels subgrouping
see  fun already
oh  you lucky dog
you're reading these cool things
i got to go work  life is so unfair
ugh
what can we do  we only got
capital that'll last a month maybe two
if we can't find investors by then
we're gonna have to lay people off
mom  dad
come kiss me good night
  i know  i know
  be right there
we got to land this  okay
did you hear dad
he sounded really upset
what was that  was it a bear
it's a bear
there are no bears
in san francisco
i saw a really hairy guy
he looked like a bear
oh  i'm so jumpy  my
nerves are short
ew  i don't wanna
hear about your nerves
i'll tell you what it is
this move has been a bust
that's what i've been
telling you guys
there're at least 37 things for
riley to be scared of right now
this smell alone is enough
to make her gag
i can't believe mom and
dad moved us here
look  i get it
you guys have concerns
but we've been through worst
tell you what  let's make a list of all
the things riley should be happy about
fine  let's see
this house stinks  our room stinks
  pizza is weird here
  our friends are back home
and all our stuff
is in the missing van
oh  come on
it could be worse
yeah  joy  we could be lying
on a dirty floor  in a bag
okay  i admit it
we had a rough start
  but think of all the good things that
  no  joy
there is absolutely no reason
for riley to be happy right now
let us handle this
i say we skip school tomorrow and
lock ourselves in the bedroom
we have no clean clothes
and we could cry
until we can't breathe
we should lock the door and
scream the curse word we know
  it's a good one
  now  hold on
look  we all have our off days
you know
hi  honey
the mom bad news train is pulling in
toot toot
still no moving van
uh huh
now they're saying it won't be here till tuesday
can you believe it
toot toot toot
  where's dad
  on the phone
this new adventure is
keeping him pretty busy
i rest my case
your dad is a little stress  you know  about
getting his new company up and running
now  for a few well place
withering scowls
i guess all i really
want to say is
thank you
you know
through all these confusion you stayed
well
you stayed our happy girl
your dad is under
a lot of pressure
but  if you and i can keep smiling
it would be a big help
we can do that for him
right
whoa

what did we do
to deserve you
  sweet dreams
  good night

important job just for you

but there is a station in imagination land
i know a shortcut
come on  this way
oh  i'm so glad
we ran into you
the station is right in here
after you
  joy
  what
well  i read about this place in the manual
we shouldn't go in there
bing bong says it's the
quickest way to headquarters
no  but joy
this is abstract thought
what are you talking about
i go in here all the time
it's a shortcut
you see
danger   keep out
d a n g e r  shortcut
i'll prove it to you
look at me
i'm crossing to the station
'cause i'm taking the shortcut
let's let's go around
this way
almost there
if you want to walk
the long way  go for it
but riley needs to be happy
i'm not missing that train
bing bong knows what he is doing
he's part dolphin  they're very smart
well  i guess
okay  what abstract concept are we
trying to comprehend today
  loneliness
  hm
i think there is
something in there
i'm going to turn it on for a minute
and burn out the gunk
what did i tell ya
you'll be in headquarters in no time

there are 4 stages
this is the first
non objective fragmentation
alright  do not panic  what is
important is that we all stay together
