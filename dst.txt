and now
dreamworks' kung fu panda  legends of awesomeness
hear the legends of the kung fu panda
raised in a noodle shop
never seeking glory or fame
he climbed a mountaintop
and earned the dragon warrior name
kung fu panda
master shifu saw the warrior blossom
and master the skills of bodacious and awesome
kung fu panda
he lives  and he trains
and he fights with the furious five
protect the valley somethin'  somethin'
somethin'  somethin' alive
kung fu panda
legends of awesomeness
sweet
panda  you're next
ten seconds to get to the other side unscathed
catlike reflexes
monkey
two points for monkey
lights out  po
get off me
po  five  monkey  four
you can't count that
sure  i can
shifu  that was a point  right
i don't care about your childish score keeping  panda
monkey  that was a deceitful  underhanded attack
good work
the point of sneak attack training
is to do the unexpected
what
see  unexpected
tigress  you and crane are next
master shifu  can we take five
so i can go sterilize my beak with hot coals
uh oh  i think i caught tigress' cold
i don't have
a cold
hey  i got a cold  too
i do not have a cold
not cool  man
friends love the sneezy trick
i do not have a
cold
wait
maybe you don't
i see
it's river fever
what's the big deal about river fever
you get a little sneezy  a little snoozy
i've personally barfed a couple of times  true story
then it's all over the next day
we all had it as kids
i didn't
oh  man
river fever's bad news if you get it as an adult
you wind up like this
is that a    a pig
there's only one cure
tea made from the sacred sun orchid
true  the sun orchid is powerful
but getting one is dangerous
it used to grow here
but now it's only found in one place
the valley of the scorpion
no one's risking their lives for me
i'll be fine
fine
look at the pig
look at the pig
you may feel fine
but the muscle spasms could start at any  
like that
tigress  if you don't get that orchid by sundown  you'll
what
i can't
what
well  first  you'll never do kung fu again
i'd rather die
yeah  that's second
well  it looks like the dragon warrior's
gonna be picking up that orchid deal y
i'll get it
50 points says i get there before you
this is no game
few have ever returned from the valley alive
and those few have come back shambling zombies
their minds destroyed by the power of scorpion sting
long ago  scorpion was a celebrated healer
an expert in medicinal plants
the soil in the valley of peace
was perfect for her experimental flowers
but when she discovered a hypnotic elixir
and stung herself with it
it warped her body and her mind
she used this new power to control others
she assaulted the valley
by turning villagers into red eyed drones
she nearly succeeded in taking over
but oogway had two things she didn't have
the villagers' loyalty and a shell
oogway exiled scorpion
but she stole the last sun orchid that grew here
she has sworn eternal vengeance
upon anyone from the valley of peace
which is why you need to be extremely
po
in case you're wondering
i'll be getting that orchid before you
'cause i've got a secret weapon  awesomeness
not a chance
i'm faster than you at everything
except eating
oh  maybe we should've stuck around and listened to shifu
man  he is such a worrier
it was just "blah  blah  blah  danger "
"blah  blah  blah  certain death" kind of stuff
you know  he should cut back on that green tea
i think it makes him a little tense
that's a lot of skulls
you want to know something interesting about skulls
you can't drink soup out of them
wow  that is interesting
to no one
come on  we got to get a move on
so pick up the pace
me
you couldn't pick up the pace with a shovel
oh  yeah  watch me fl  
uh  think anybody heard that
think anybody didn't hear that
ooh  visitors from the valley of peace
i think i dislocated my forehead
it's that adorable panda dragon warrior they speak of
uh  my brain's like a bag of pudding
ha  nothing new
come on
tigress needs that orchid by sundown
oh  they need my orchid
and i need to add something to my collection of tchotchkes
his adorable panda head will fit right here
once i sever it from his body
ooh  yes  you come and get your medicine for your lady friend
i've got it right here
you know what else is interesting about skulls
they run faster than you
ah  what i lack in   speed
i make up for    in   stamina
don't hurl  don't hurl
monkey
i'm gonna    catch you
good luck  po
scorpion
you can't beat me
i already have
poison
not exactly
oh  i could simply have poisoned you and your panda friend
but i'm a shut in  thanks to oogway
and this is my only entertainment
it'll be so much more fun to watch
as you destroy shifu's little pet
the dragon warrior
no

you're only good to me as long as you forget that he is your friend
forget my friend
and destroy him
and
